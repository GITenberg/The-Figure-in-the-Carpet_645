THE FIGURE IN THE CARPET<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I had done a few things and earned a few pence - I had perhaps even
had time to begin to think I was finer than was perceived by the patronising;
but when I take the little measure of my course (a fidgety habit, for
it&rsquo;s none of the longest yet) I count my real start from the evening
George Corvick, breathless and worried, came in to ask me a service.&nbsp;
He had done more things than I, and earned more pence, though there
were chances for cleverness I thought he sometimes missed.&nbsp; I could
only however that evening declare to him that he never missed one for
kindness.&nbsp; There was almost rapture in hearing it proposed to me
to prepare for <i>The Middle</i>, the organ of our lucubrations, so
called from the position in the week of its day of appearance, an article
for which he had made himself responsible and of which, tied up with
a stout string, he laid on my table the subject.&nbsp; I pounced upon
my opportunity - that is on the first volume of it - and paid scant
attention to my friend&rsquo;s explanation of his appeal.&nbsp; What
explanation could be more to the point than my obvious fitness for the
task?&nbsp; I had written on Hugh Vereker, but never a word in <i>The
Middle</i>, where my dealings were mainly with the ladies and the minor
poets.&nbsp; This was his new novel, an advance copy, and whatever much
or little it should do for his reputation I was clear on the spot as
to what it should do for mine.&nbsp; Moreover if I always read him as
soon as I could get hold of him I had a particular reason for wishing
to read him now: I had accepted an invitation to Bridges for the following
Sunday, and it had been mentioned in Lady Jane&rsquo;s note that Mr.
Vereker was to be there.&nbsp; I was young enough for a flutter at meeting
a man of his renown, and innocent enough to believe the occasion would
demand the display of an acquaintance with his &ldquo;last.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Corvick, who had promised a review of it, had not even had time to read
it; he had gone to pieces in consequence of news requiring - as on precipitate
reflexion he judged - that he should catch the night-mail to Paris.&nbsp;
He had had a telegram from Gwendolen Erme in answer to his letter offering
to fly to her aid.&nbsp; I knew already about Gwendolen Erme; I had
never seen her, but I had my ideas, which were mainly to the effect
that Corvick would marry her if her mother would only die.&nbsp; That
lady seemed now in a fair way to oblige him; after some dreadful mistake
about a climate or a &ldquo;cure&rdquo; she had suddenly collapsed on
the return from abroad.&nbsp; Her daughter, unsupported and alarmed,
desiring to make a rush for home but hesitating at the risk, had accepted
our friend&rsquo;s assistance, and it was my secret belief that at sight
of him Mrs. Erme would pull round.&nbsp; His own belief was scarcely
to be called secret; it discernibly at any rate differed from mine.&nbsp;
He had showed me Gwendolen&rsquo;s photograph with the remark that she
wasn&rsquo;t pretty but was awfully interesting; she had published at
the age of nineteen a novel in three volumes, &ldquo;Deep Down,&rdquo;
about which, in <i>The Middle</i>, he had been really splendid.&nbsp;
He appreciated my present eagerness and undertook that the periodical
in question should do no less; then at the last, with his hand on the
door, he said to me: &ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;ll be all right, you
know.&rdquo;&nbsp; Seeing I was a trifle vague he added: &ldquo;I mean
you won&rsquo;t be silly.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Silly - about Vereker!&nbsp; Why what do I ever find him but
awfully clever?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s that but silly?&nbsp; What on earth does &lsquo;awfully
clever&rsquo; mean?&nbsp; For God&rsquo;s sake try to get <i>at</i>
him.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let him suffer by our arrangement.&nbsp; Speak
of him, you know, if you can, as <i>I</i> should have spoken of him.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I wondered an instant.&nbsp; &ldquo;You mean as far and away the biggest
of the lot - that sort of thing?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Corvick almost groaned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh you know, I don&rsquo;t put
them back to back that way; it&rsquo;s the infancy of art!&nbsp; But
he gives me a pleasure so rare; the sense of&rdquo; - he mused a little
- &ldquo;something or other.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I wondered again.&nbsp; &ldquo;The sense, pray, of want?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My dear man, that&rsquo;s just what I want <i>you</i> to say!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Even before he had banged the door I had begun, book in hand, to prepare
myself to say it.&nbsp; I sat up with Vereker half the night; Corvick
couldn&rsquo;t have done more than that.&nbsp; He was awfully clever
- I stuck to that, but he wasn&rsquo;t a bit the biggest of the lot.&nbsp;
I didn&rsquo;t allude to the lot, however; I flattered myself that I
emerged on this occasion from the infancy of art.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
all right,&rdquo; they declared vividly at the office; and when the
number appeared I felt there was a basis on which I could meet the great
man.&nbsp; It gave me confidence for a day or two - then that confidence
dropped.&nbsp; I had fancied him reading it with relish, but if Corvick
wasn&rsquo;t satisfied how could Vereker himself be?&nbsp; I reflected
indeed that the heat of the admirer was sometimes grosser even than
the appetite of the scribe.&nbsp; Corvick at all events wrote me from
Paris a little ill-humouredly.&nbsp; Mrs. Erme was pulling round, and
I hadn&rsquo;t at all said what Vereker gave him the sense of.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER II<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The effect of my visit to Bridges was to turn me out for more profundity.&nbsp;
Hugh Vereker, as I saw him there, was of a contact so void of angles
that I blushed for the poverty of imagination involved in my small precautions.&nbsp;
If he was in spirits it wasn&rsquo;t because he had read my review;
in fact on the Sunday morning I felt sure he hadn&rsquo;t read it, though
<i>The Middle</i> had been out three days and bloomed, I assured myself,
in the stiff garden of periodicals which gave one of the ormolu tables
the air of a stand at a station.&nbsp; The impression he made on me
personally was such that I wished him to read it, and I corrected to
this end with a surreptitious hand what might be wanting in the careless
conspicuity of the sheet.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid I even watched the
result of my manoeuvre, but up to luncheon I watched in vain.<br>
<br>
When afterwards, in the course of our gregarious walk, I found myself
for half an hour, not perhaps without another manoeuvre, at the great
man&rsquo;s side, the result of his affability was a still livelier
desire that he shouldn&rsquo;t remain in ignorance of the peculiar justice
I had done him.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t that he seemed to thirst for justice;
on the contrary I hadn&rsquo;t yet caught in his talk the faintest grunt
of a grudge - a note for which my young experience had already given
me an ear.&nbsp; Of late he had had more recognition, and it was pleasant,
as we used to say in <i>The Middle</i>, to see how it drew him out.&nbsp;
He wasn&rsquo;t of course popular, but I judged one of the sources of
his good humour to be precisely that his success was independent of
that.&nbsp; He had none the less become in a manner the fashion; the
critics at least had put on a spurt and caught up with him.&nbsp; We
had found out at last how clever he was, and he had had to make the
best of the loss of his mystery.&nbsp; I was strongly tempted, as I
walked beside him, to let him know how much of that unveiling was my
act; and there was a moment when I probably should have done so had
not one of the ladies of our party, snatching a place at his other elbow,
just then appealed to him in a spirit comparatively selfish.&nbsp; It
was very discouraging: I almost felt the liberty had been taken with
myself.<br>
<br>
I had had on my tongue&rsquo;s end, for my own part, a phrase or two
about the right word at the right time; but later on I was glad not
to have spoken, for when on our return we clustered at tea I perceived
Lady Jane, who had not been out with us, brandishing <i>The Middle</i>
with her longest arm.&nbsp; She had taken it up at her leisure; she
was delighted with what she had found, and I saw that, as a mistake
in a man may often be a felicity in a woman, she would practically do
for me what I hadn&rsquo;t been able to do for myself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some
sweet little truths that needed to be spoken,&rdquo; I heard her declare,
thrusting the paper at rather a bewildered couple by the fireplace.&nbsp;
She grabbed it away from them again on the reappearance of Hugh Vereker,
who after our walk had been upstairs to change something.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
know you don&rsquo;t in general look at this kind of thing, but it&rsquo;s
an occasion really for doing so.&nbsp; You <i>haven&rsquo;t</i> seen
it?&nbsp; Then you must.&nbsp; The man has actually got <i>at</i> you,
at what <i>I</i> always feel, you know.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lady Jane threw
into her eyes a look evidently intended to give an idea of what she
always felt; but she added that she couldn&rsquo;t have expressed it.&nbsp;
The man in the paper expressed it in a striking manner.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just
see there, and there, where I&rsquo;ve dashed it, how he brings it out.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She had literally marked for him the brightest patches of my prose,
and if I was a little amused Vereker himself may well have been.&nbsp;
He showed how much he was when before us all Lady Jane wanted to read
something aloud.&nbsp; I liked at any rate the way he defeated her purpose
by jerking the paper affectionately out of her clutch.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d
take it upstairs with him and look at it on going to dress.&nbsp; He
did this half an hour later - I saw it in his hand when he repaired
to his room.&nbsp; That was the moment at which, thinking to give her
pleasure, I mentioned to Lady Jane that I was the author of the review.&nbsp;
I did give her pleasure, I judged, but perhaps not quite so much as
I had expected.&nbsp; If the author was &ldquo;only me&rdquo; the thing
didn&rsquo;t seem quite so remarkable.&nbsp; Hadn&rsquo;t I had the
effect rather of diminishing the lustre of the article than of adding
to my own?&nbsp; Her ladyship was subject to the most extraordinary
drops.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t matter; the only effect I cared about was
the one it would have on Vereker up there by his bedroom fire.<br>
<br>
At dinner I watched for the signs of this impression, tried to fancy
some happier light in his eyes; but to my disappointment Lady Jane gave
me no chance to make sure.&nbsp; I had hoped she&rsquo;d call triumphantly
down the table, publicly demand if she hadn&rsquo;t been right.&nbsp;
The party was large - there were people from outside as well, but I
had never seen a table long enough to deprive Lady Jane of a triumph.&nbsp;
I was just reflecting in truth that this interminable board would deprive
<i>me</i> of one when the guest next me, dear woman - she was Miss Poyle,
the vicar&rsquo;s sister, a robust unmodulated person - had the happy
inspiration and the unusual courage to address herself across it to
Vereker, who was opposite, but not directly, so that when he replied
they were both leaning forward.&nbsp; She enquired, artless body, what
he thought of Lady Jane&rsquo;s &ldquo;panegyric,&rdquo; which she had
read - not connecting it however with her right-hand neighbour; and
while I strained my ear for his reply I heard him, to my stupefaction,
call back gaily, his mouth full of bread: &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all
right - the usual twaddle!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I had caught Vereker&rsquo;s glance as he spoke, but Miss Poyle&rsquo;s
surprise was a fortunate cover for my own.&nbsp; &ldquo;You mean he
doesn&rsquo;t do you justice?&rdquo; said the excellent woman.<br>
<br>
Vereker laughed out, and I was happy to be able to do the same.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a charming article,&rdquo; he tossed us.<br>
<br>
Miss Poyle thrust her chin half across the cloth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re
so deep!&rdquo; she drove home.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;As deep as the ocean!&nbsp; All I pretend is that the author
doesn&rsquo;t see - &rdquo;&nbsp; But a dish was at this point passed
over his shoulder, and we had to wait while he helped himself.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t see what?&rdquo; my neighbour continued.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t see anything.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Dear me - how very stupid!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; Vereker laughed main.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nobody does.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The lady on his further side appealed to him, and Miss Poyle sank back
to myself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nobody sees anything!&rdquo; she cheerfully
announced; to which I replied that I had often thought so too, but had
somehow taken the thought for a proof on my own part of a tremendous
eye.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t tell her the article was mine; and I observed
that Lady Jane, occupied at the end of the table, had not caught Vereker&rsquo;s
words.<br>
<br>
I rather avoided him after dinner, for I confess he struck me as cruelly
conceited, and the revelation was a pain.&nbsp; &ldquo;The usual twaddle&rdquo;
- my acute little study!&nbsp; That one&rsquo;s admiration should have
had a reserve or two could gall him to that point!&nbsp; I had thought
him placid, and he was placid enough; such a surface was the hard polished
glass that encased the bauble of his vanity.&nbsp; I was really ruffled,
and the only comfort was that if nobody saw anything George Corvick
was quite as much out of it as I.&nbsp; This comfort however was not
sufficient, after the ladies had dispersed, to carry me in the proper
manner - I mean in a spotted jacket and humming an air - into the smoking-room.&nbsp;
I took my way in some dejection to bed; but in the passage I encountered
Mr. Vereker, who had been up once more to change, coming out of his
room.&nbsp; <i>He</i> was humming an air and had on a spotted jacket,
and as soon as he saw me his gaiety gave a start.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My dear young man,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad
to lay hands on you!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid I most unwittingly wounded
you by those words of mine at dinner to Miss Poyle.&nbsp; I learned
but half an hour ago from Lady Jane that you&rsquo;re the author of
the little notice in <i>The Middle</i>.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I protested that no bones were broken; but he moved with me to my own
door, his hand, on my shoulder, kindly feeling for a fracture; and on
hearing that I had come up to bed he asked leave to cross my threshold
and just tell me in three words what his qualification of my remarks
had represented.&nbsp; It was plain he really feared I was hurt, and
the sense of his solicitude suddenly made all the difference to me.&nbsp;
My cheap review fluttered off into space, and the best things I had
said in it became flat enough beside the brilliancy of his being there.&nbsp;
I can see him there still, on my rug, in the firelight and his spotted
jacket, his fine clear face all bright with the desire to be tender
to my youth.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what he had at first meant to
say, but I think the sight of my relief touched him, excited him, brought
up words to his lips from far within.&nbsp; It was so these words presently
conveyed to me something that, as I afterwards knew, he had never uttered
to any one.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve always done justice to the generous impulse
that made him speak; it was simply compunction for a snub unconsciously
administered to a man of letters in a position inferior to his own,
a man of letters moreover in the very act of praising him.&nbsp; To
make the thing right he talked to me exactly as an equal and on the
ground of what we both loved best.&nbsp; The hour, the place, the unexpectedness
deepened the impression: he couldn&rsquo;t have done anything more intensely
effective.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER III.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite know how to explain it to you,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;but it was the very fact that your notice of my book had
a spice of intelligence, it was just your exceptional sharpness, that
produced the feeling - a very old story with me, I beg you to believe
- under the momentary influence of which I used in speaking to that
good lady the words you so naturally resent.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t read
the things in the newspapers unless they&rsquo;re thrust upon me as
that one was - it&rsquo;s always one&rsquo;s best friend who does it!&nbsp;
But I used to read them sometimes - ten years ago.&nbsp; I dare say
they were in general rather stupider then; at any rate it always struck
me they missed my little point with a perfection exactly as admirable
when they patted me on the back as when they kicked me in the shins.&nbsp;
Whenever since I&rsquo;ve happened to have a glimpse of them they were
still blazing away - still missing it, I mean, deliciously.&nbsp; <i>You</i>
miss it, my dear fellow, with inimitable assurance; the fact of your
being awfully clever and your article&rsquo;s being awfully nice doesn&rsquo;t
make a hair&rsquo;s breadth of difference.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s quite with
you rising young men,&rdquo; Vereker laughed, &ldquo;that I feel most
what a failure I am!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I listened with keen interest; it grew keener as he talked.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>You</i>
a failure - heavens!&nbsp; What then may your &lsquo;little point&rsquo;
happen to be?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Have I got to <i>tell</i> you, after all these years and labours?&rdquo;&nbsp;
There was something in the friendly reproach of this - jocosely exaggerated
- that made me, as an ardent young seeker for truth, blush to the roots
of my hair.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m as much in the dark as ever, though I&rsquo;ve
grown used in a sense to my obtuseness; at that moment, however, Vereker&rsquo;s
happy accent made me appear to myself, and probably to him, a rare dunce.&nbsp;
I was on the point of exclaiming &ldquo;Ah yes, don&rsquo;t tell me:
for my honour, for that of the craft, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; when he went
on in a manner that showed he had read my thought and had his own idea
of the probability of our some day redeeming ourselves.&nbsp; &ldquo;By
my little point I mean - what shall I call it? - the particular thing
I&rsquo;ve written my books most <i>for</i>.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t there
for every writer a particular thing of that sort, the thing that most
makes him apply himself, the thing without the effort to achieve which
he wouldn&rsquo;t write at all, the very passion of his passion, the
part of the business in which, for him, the flame of art burns most
intensely?&nbsp; Well, it&rsquo;s <i>that</i>!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I considered a moment - that is I followed at a respectful distance,
rather gasping.&nbsp; I was fascinated - easily, you&rsquo;ll say; but
I wasn&rsquo;t going after all to be put off my guard.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your
description&rsquo;s certainly beautiful, but it doesn&rsquo;t make what
you describe very distinct.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I promise you it would be distinct if it should dawn on you at
all.&rdquo;&nbsp; I saw that the charm of our topic overflowed for my
companion into an emotion as lively as my own.&nbsp; &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo;
he went on, &ldquo;I can speak for myself: there&rsquo;s an idea in
my work without which I wouldn&rsquo;t have given a straw for the whole
job.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the finest fullest intention of the lot, and the
application of it has been, I think, a triumph of patience, of ingenuity.&nbsp;
I ought to leave that to somebody else to say; but that nobody does
say it is precisely what we&rsquo;re talking about.&nbsp; It stretches,
this little trick of mine, from book to book, and everything else, comparatively,
plays over the surface of it.&nbsp; The order, the form, the texture
of my books will perhaps some day constitute for the initiated a complete
representation of it.&nbsp; So it&rsquo;s naturally the thing for the
critic to look for.&nbsp; It strikes me,&rdquo; my visitor added, smiling,
&ldquo;even as the thing for the critic to find.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
This seemed a responsibility indeed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You call it a little
trick?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only my little modesty.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s really
an exquisite scheme.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And you hold that you&rsquo;ve carried the scheme out?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The way I&rsquo;ve carried it out is the thing in life I think
a bit well of myself for.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I had a pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you ought - just a
trifle - to assist the critic?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Assist him?&nbsp; What else have I done with every stroke of
my pen?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve shouted my intention in his great blank face!&rdquo;&nbsp;
At this, laughing out again, Vereker laid his hand on my shoulder to
show the allusion wasn&rsquo;t to my personal appearance.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But you talk about the initiated.&nbsp; There must therefore,
you see, <i>be</i> initiation.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What else in heaven&rsquo;s name is criticism supposed to be?&rdquo;&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m afraid I coloured at this too; but I took refuge in repeating
that his account of his silver lining was poor in something or other
that a plain man knows things by.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s only because
you&rsquo;ve never had a glimpse of it,&rdquo; he returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
you had had one the element in question would soon have become practically
all you&rsquo;d see.&nbsp; To me it&rsquo;s exactly as palpable as the
marble of this chimney.&nbsp; Besides, the critic just <i>isn&rsquo;t</i>
a plain man: if he were, pray, what would he be doing in his neighbour&rsquo;s
garden?&nbsp; You&rsquo;re anything but a plain man yourself, and the
very raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre of you all is that you&rsquo;re little
demons of subtlety.&nbsp; If my great affair&rsquo;s a secret, that&rsquo;s
only because it&rsquo;s a secret in spite of itself - the amazing event
has made it one.&nbsp; I not only never took the smallest precaution
to keep it so, but never dreamed of any such accident.&nbsp; If I had
I shouldn&rsquo;t in advance have had the heart to go on.&nbsp; As it
was, I only became aware little by little, and meanwhile I had done
my work.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And now you quite like it?&rdquo; I risked.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My work?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Your secret.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the same thing.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Your guessing that,&rdquo; Vereker replied, &ldquo;is a proof
that you&rsquo;re as clever as I say!&rdquo;&nbsp; I was encouraged
by this to remark that he would clearly be pained to part with it, and
he confessed that it was indeed with him now the great amusement of
life.&nbsp; &ldquo;I live almost to see if it will ever be detected.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He looked at me for a jesting challenge; something far within his eyes
seemed to peep out.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I needn&rsquo;t worry - it won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You fire me as I&rsquo;ve never been fired,&rdquo; I declared;
&ldquo;you make me determined to do or die.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then I asked:
&ldquo;Is it a kind of esoteric message?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
His countenance fell at this - he put out his hand as if to bid me good-night.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah my dear fellow, it can&rsquo;t be described in cheap journalese!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I knew of course he&rsquo;d be awfully fastidious, but our talk had
made me feel how much his nerves were exposed.&nbsp; I was unsatisfied
- I kept hold of his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t make use of the
expression then,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;in the article in which I shall
eventually announce my discovery, though I dare say I shall have hard
work to do without it.&nbsp; But meanwhile, just to hasten that difficult
birth, can&rsquo;t you give a fellow a clue?&rdquo;&nbsp; I felt much
more at my ease.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My whole lucid effort gives him the clue - every page and line
and letter.&nbsp; The thing&rsquo;s as concrete there as a bird in a
cage, a bait on a hook, a piece of cheese in a mouse-trap.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
stuck into every volume as your foot is stuck into your shoe.&nbsp;
It governs every line, it chooses every word, it dots every i, it places
every comma.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I scratched my head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it something in the style or something
in the thought?&nbsp; An element of form or an element of feeling?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He indulgently shook my hand again, and I felt my questions to be crude
and my distinctions pitiful.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good-night, my dear boy -
don&rsquo;t bother about it.&nbsp; After all, you do like a fellow.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And a little intelligence might spoil it?&rdquo; I still detained
him.<br>
<br>
He hesitated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve got a heart in your body.&nbsp;
Is that an element of form or an element of feeling?&nbsp; What I contend
that nobody has ever mentioned in my work is the organ of life.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I see - it&rsquo;s some idea <i>about</i> life, some sort of
philosophy.&nbsp; Unless it be,&rdquo; I added with the eagerness of
a thought perhaps still happier, &ldquo;some kind of game you&rsquo;re
up to with your style, something you&rsquo;re after in the language.&nbsp;
Perhaps it&rsquo;s a preference for the letter P!&rdquo; I ventured
profanely to break out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Papa, potatoes, prunes - that sort
of thing?&rdquo;&nbsp; He was suitably indulgent: he only said I hadn&rsquo;t
got the right letter.&nbsp; But his amusement was over; I could see
he was bored.&nbsp; There was nevertheless something else I had absolutely
to learn.&nbsp; &ldquo;Should you be able, pen in hand, to state it
clearly yourself - to name it, phrase it, formulate it?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he almost passionately sighed, &ldquo;if I were only,
pen in hand, one of <i>you</i> chaps!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That would be a great chance for you of course.&nbsp; But why
should you despise us chaps for not doing what you can&rsquo;t do yourself?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t do?&rdquo;&nbsp; He opened his eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t
I done it in twenty volumes?&nbsp; I do it in my way,&rdquo; he continued.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Go <i>you</i> and don&rsquo;t do it in yours.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ours is so devilish difficult,&rdquo; I weakly observed.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;So&rsquo;s mine.&nbsp; We each choose our own.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
no compulsion.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t come down and smoke?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No.&nbsp; I want to think this thing out.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll tell me then in the morning that you&rsquo;ve laid
me bare?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what I can do; I&rsquo;ll sleep on it.&nbsp; But
just one word more,&rdquo; I added.&nbsp; We had left the room - I walked
again with him a few steps along the passage.&nbsp; &ldquo;This extraordinary
&lsquo;general intention,&rsquo; as you call it - for that&rsquo;s the
most vivid description I can induce you to make of it - is then, generally,
a sort of buried treasure?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
His face lighted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, call it that, though it&rsquo;s
perhaps not for me to do so.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; I laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know you&rsquo;re
hugely proud of it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t propose to tell you so; but it <i>is</i>
the joy of my soul!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You mean it&rsquo;s a beauty so rare, so great?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He waited a little again.&nbsp; &ldquo;The loveliest thing in the world!&rdquo;&nbsp;
We had stopped, and on these words he left me; but at the end of the
corridor, while I looked after him rather yearningly, he turned and
caught sight of my puzzled face.&nbsp; It made him earnestly, indeed
I thought quite anxiously, shake his head and wave his finger &ldquo;Give
it up - give it up!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
This wasn&rsquo;t a challenge - it was fatherly advice.&nbsp; If I had
had one of his books at hand I&rsquo;d have repeated my recent act of
faith - I&rsquo;d have spent half the night with him.&nbsp; At three
o&rsquo;clock in the morning, not sleeping, remembering moreover how
indispensable he was to Lady Jane, I stole down to the library with
a candle.&nbsp; There wasn&rsquo;t, so far as I could discover, a line
of his writing in the house.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER IV.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Returning to town I feverishly collected them all; I picked out each
in its order and held it up to the light.&nbsp; This gave me a maddening
month, in the course of which several things took place.&nbsp; One of
these, the last, I may as well immediately mention, was that I acted
on Vereker&rsquo;s advice: I renounced my ridiculous attempt.&nbsp;
I could really make nothing of the business; it proved a dead loss.&nbsp;
After all I had always, as he had himself noted, liked him; and what
now occurred was simply that my new intelligence and vain preoccupation
damaged my liking.&nbsp; I not only failed to run a general intention
to earth, I found myself missing the subordinate intentions I had formerly
enjoyed.&nbsp; His books didn&rsquo;t even remain the charming things
they had been for me; the exasperation of my search put me out of conceit
of them.&nbsp; Instead of being a pleasure the more they became a resource
the less; for from the moment I was unable to follow up the author&rsquo;s
hint I of course felt it a point of honour not to make use professionally
of my knowledge of them.&nbsp; I <i>had</i> no knowledge - nobody had
any.&nbsp; It was humiliating, but I could bear it - they only annoyed
me now.&nbsp; At last they even bored me, and I accounted for my confusion
- perversely, I allow - by the idea that Vereker had made a fool of
me.&nbsp; The buried treasure was a bad joke, the general intention
a monstrous pose.<br>
<br>
The great point of it all is, however, that I told George Corvick what
had befallen me and that my information had an immense effect upon him.&nbsp;
He had at last come back, but so, unfortunately, had Mrs. Erme, and
there was as yet, I could see, no question of his nuptials.&nbsp; He
was immensely stirred up by the anecdote I had brought from Bridges;
it fell in so completely with the sense he had had from the first that
there was more in Vereker than met the eye.&nbsp; When I remarked that
the eye seemed what the printed page had been expressly invented to
meet he immediately accused me of being spiteful because I had been
foiled.&nbsp; Our commerce had always that pleasant latitude.&nbsp;
The thing Vereker had mentioned to me was exactly the thing he, Corvick,
had wanted me to speak of in my review.&nbsp; On my suggesting at last
that with the assistance I had now given him he would doubtless be prepared
to speak of it himself he admitted freely that before doing this there
was more he must understand.&nbsp; What he would have said, had he reviewed
the new book, was that there was evidently in the writer&rsquo;s inmost
art something to <i>be</i> understood.&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t so much
as hinted at that: no wonder the writer hadn&rsquo;t been flattered!&nbsp;
I asked Corvick what he really considered he meant by his own supersubtlety,
and, unmistakeably kindled, he replied: &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t for the
vulgar - it isn&rsquo;t for the vulgar!&rdquo;&nbsp; He had hold of
the tail of something; he would pull hard, pull it right out.&nbsp;
He pumped me dry on Vereker&rsquo;s strange confidence and, pronouncing
me the luckiest of mortals, mentioned half a dozen questions he wished
to goodness I had had the gumption to put.&nbsp; Yet on the other hand
he didn&rsquo;t want to be told too much - it would spoil the fun of
seeing what would come.&nbsp; The failure of <i>my</i> fun was at the
moment of our meeting not complete, but I saw it ahead, and Corvick
saw that I saw it.&nbsp; I, on my side, saw likewise that one of the
first things he would do would be to rush off with my story to Gwendolen.<br>
<br>
On the very day after my talk with him I was surprised by the receipt
of a note from Hugh Vereker, to whom our encounter at Bridges had been
recalled, as he mentioned, by his falling, in a magazine, on some article
to which my signature was attached.&nbsp; &ldquo;I read it with great
pleasure,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;and remembered under its influence
our lively conversation by your bedroom fire.&nbsp; The consequence
of this has been that I begin to measure the temerity of my having saddled
you with a knowledge that you may find something of a burden.&nbsp;
Now that the fit&rsquo;s over I can&rsquo;t imagine how I came to be
moved so much beyond my wont.&nbsp; I had never before mentioned, no
matter in what state of expansion, the fact of my little secret, and
I shall never speak of that mystery again.&nbsp; I was accidentally
so much more explicit with you than it had ever entered into my game
to be, that I find this game - I mean the pleasure of playing it - suffers
considerably.&nbsp; In short, if you can understand it, I&rsquo;ve rather
spoiled my sport.&nbsp; I really don&rsquo;t want to give anybody what
I believe you clever young men call the tip.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s of course
a selfish solicitude, and I name it to you for what it may be worth
to you.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re disposed to humour me don&rsquo;t repeat
my revelation.&nbsp; Think me demented - it&rsquo;s your right; but
don&rsquo;t tell anybody why.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The sequel to this communication was that as early on the morrow as
I dared I drove straight to Mr. Vereker&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; He occupied
in those years one of the honest old houses in Kensington Square.&nbsp;
He received me immediately, and as soon as I came in I saw I hadn&rsquo;t
lost my power to minister to his mirth.&nbsp; He laughed out at sight
of my face, which doubtless expressed my perturbation.&nbsp; I had been
indiscreet - my compunction was great.&nbsp; &ldquo;I <i>have</i> told
somebody,&rdquo; I panted, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m sure that person will
by this time have told somebody else!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a woman, into
the bargain.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The person you&rsquo;ve told?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No, the other person.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m quite sure he must have
told her.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;For all the good it will do her - or do <i>me</i>!&nbsp; A woman
will never find out.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No, but she&rsquo;ll talk all over the place: she&rsquo;ll do
just what you don&rsquo;t want.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Vereker thought a moment, but wasn&rsquo;t so disconcerted as I had
feared: he felt that if the harm was done it only served him right.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter - don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best, I promise you, that your talk with me
shall go no further.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Very good; do what you can.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;In the meantime,&rdquo; I pursued, &ldquo;George Corvick&rsquo;s
possession of the tip may, on his part, really lead to something.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That will be a brave day.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I told him about Corvick&rsquo;s cleverness, his admiration, the intensity
of his interest in my anecdote; and without making too much of the divergence
of our respective estimates mentioned that my friend was already of
opinion that he saw much further into a certain affair than most people.&nbsp;
He was quite as fired as I had been at Bridges.&nbsp; He was moreover
in love with the young lady: perhaps the two together would puzzle something
out.<br>
<br>
Vereker seemed struck with this.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you mean they&rsquo;re
to be married?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I dare say that&rsquo;s what it will come to.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That may help them,&rdquo; he conceded, &ldquo;but we must give
them time!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I spoke of my own renewed assault and confessed my difficulties; whereupon
he repeated his former advice: &ldquo;Give it up, give it up!&rdquo;&nbsp;
He evidently didn&rsquo;t think me intellectually equipped for the adventure.&nbsp;
I stayed half an hour, and he was most good-natured, but I couldn&rsquo;t
help pronouncing him a man of unstable moods.&nbsp; He had been free
with me in a mood, he had repented in a mood, and now in a mood he had
turned indifferent.&nbsp; This general levity helped me to believe that,
so far as the subject of the tip went, there wasn&rsquo;t much in it.&nbsp;
I contrived however to make him answer a few more questions about it,
though he did so with visible impatience.&nbsp; For himself, beyond
doubt, the thing we were all so blank about was vividly there.&nbsp;
It was something, I guessed, in the primal plan, something like a complex
figure in a Persian carpet.&nbsp; He highly approved of this image when
I used it, and he used another himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
very string,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that my pearls are strung on!&rdquo;&nbsp;
The reason of his note to me had been that he really didn&rsquo;t want
to give us a grain of succour - our density was a thing too perfect
in its way to touch.&nbsp; He had formed the habit of depending on it,
and if the spell was to break it must break by some force of its own.&nbsp;
He comes back to me from that last occasion - for I was never to speak
to him again - as a man with some safe preserve for sport.&nbsp; I wondered
as I walked away where he had got <i>his</i> tip.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER V.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
When I spoke to George Corvick of the caution I had received he made
me feel that any doubt of his delicacy would be almost an insult.&nbsp;
He had instantly told Gwendolen, but Gwendolen&rsquo;s ardent response
was in itself a pledge of discretion.&nbsp; The question would now absorb
them and would offer them a pastime too precious to be shared with the
crowd.&nbsp; They appeared to have caught instinctively at Vereker&rsquo;s
high idea of enjoyment.&nbsp; Their intellectual pride, however, was
not such as to make them indifferent to any further light I might throw
on the affair they had in hand.&nbsp; They were indeed of the &ldquo;artistic
temperament,&rdquo; and I was freshly struck with my colleague&rsquo;s
power to excite himself over a question of art.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d call
it letters, he&rsquo;d call it life, but it was all one thing.&nbsp;
In what he said I now seemed to understand that he spoke equally for
Gwendolen, to whom, as soon as Mrs. Erme was sufficiently better to
allow her a little leisure, he made a point of introducing me.&nbsp;
I remember our going together one Sunday in August to a huddled house
in Chelsea, and my renewed envy of Corvick&rsquo;s possession of a friend
who had some light to mingle with his own.&nbsp; He could say things
to her that I could never say to him.&nbsp; She had indeed no sense
of humour and, with her pretty way of holding her head on one side,
was one of those persons whom you want, as the phrase is, to shake,
but who have learnt Hungarian by themselves.&nbsp; She conversed perhaps
in Hungarian with Corvick; she had remarkably little English for his
friend.&nbsp; Corvick afterwards told me that I had chilled her by my
apparent indisposition to oblige them with the detail of what Vereker
had said to me.&nbsp; I allowed that I felt I had given thought enough
to that indication: hadn&rsquo;t I even made up my mind that it was
vain and would lead nowhere?&nbsp; The importance they attached to it
was irritating and quite envenomed my doubts.<br>
<br>
That statement looks unamiable, and what probably happened was that
I felt humiliated at seeing other persons deeply beguiled by an experiment
that had brought me only chagrin.&nbsp; I was out in the cold while,
by the evening fire, under the lamp, they followed the chase for which
I myself had sounded the horn.&nbsp; They did as I had done, only more
deliberately and sociably - they went over their author from the beginning.&nbsp;
There was no hurry, Corvick said the future was before them and the
fascination could only grow; they would take him page by page, as they
would take one of the classics, inhale him in slow draughts and let
him sink all the way in.&nbsp; They would scarce have got so wound up,
I think, if they hadn&rsquo;t been in love: poor Vereker&rsquo;s inner
meaning gave them endless occasion to put and to keep their young heads
together.&nbsp; None the less it represented the kind of problem for
which Corvick had a special aptitude, drew out the particular pointed
patience of which, had he lived, he would have given more striking and,
it is to be hoped, more fruitful examples.&nbsp; He at least was, in
Vereker&rsquo;s words, a little demon of subtlety.&nbsp; We had begun
by disputing, but I soon saw that without my stirring a finger his infatuation
would have its bad hours.&nbsp; He would bound off on false scents as
I had done - he would clap his hands over new lights and see them blown
out by the wind of the turned page.&nbsp; He was like nothing, I told
him, but the maniacs who embrace some bedlamitical theory of the cryptic
character of Shakespeare.&nbsp; To this he replied that if we had had
Shakespeare&rsquo;s own word for his being cryptic he would at once
have accepted it.&nbsp; The case there was altogether different - we
had nothing but the word of Mr. Snooks.&nbsp; I returned that I was
stupefied to see him attach such importance even to the word of Mr.
Vereker.&nbsp; He wanted thereupon to know if I treated Mr. Vereker&rsquo;s
word as a lie.&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t perhaps prepared, in my unhappy
rebound, to go so far as that, but I insisted that till the contrary
was proved I should view it as too fond an imagination.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t,
I confess, say - I didn&rsquo;t at that time quite know - all I felt.&nbsp;
Deep down, as Miss Erme would have said, I was uneasy, I was expectant.&nbsp;
At the core of my disconcerted state - for my wonted curiosity lived
in its ashes - was the sharpness of a sense that Corvick would at last
probably come out somewhere.&nbsp; He made, in defence of his credulity,
a great point of the fact that from of old, in his study of this genius,
he had caught whiffs and hints of he didn&rsquo;t know what, faint wandering
notes of a hidden music.&nbsp; That was just the rarity, that was the
charm: it fitted so perfectly into what I reported.<br>
<br>
If I returned on several occasions to the little house in Chelsea I
dare say it was as much for news of Vereker as for news of Miss Erme&rsquo;s
ailing parent.&nbsp; The hours spent there by Corvick were present to
my fancy as those of a chessplayer bent with a silent scowl, all the
lamplit winter, over his board and his moves.&nbsp; As my imagination
filled it out the picture held me fast.&nbsp; On the other side of the
table was a ghostlier form, the faint figure of an antagonist good-humouredly
but a little wearily secure - an antagonist who leaned back in his chair
with his hands in his pockets and a smile on his fine clear face.&nbsp;
Close to Corvick, behind him, was a girl who had begun to strike me
as pale and wasted and even, on more familiar view, as rather handsome,
and who rested on his shoulder and hung on his moves.&nbsp; He would
take up a chessman and hold it poised a while over one of the little
squares, and then would put it back in its place with a long sigh of
disappointment.&nbsp; The young lady, at this, would slightly but uneasily
shift her position and look across, very hard, very long, very strangely,
at their dim participant.&nbsp; I had asked them at an early stage of
the business if it mightn&rsquo;t contribute to their success to have
some closer communication with him.&nbsp; The special circumstances
would surely be held to have given me a right to introduce them.&nbsp;
Corvick immediately replied that he had no wish to approach the altar
before he had prepared the sacrifice.&nbsp; He quite agreed with our
friend both as to the delight and as to the honour of the chase - he
would bring down the animal with his own rifle.&nbsp; When I asked him
if Miss Erme were as keen a shot he said after thinking: &ldquo;No,
I&rsquo;m ashamed to say she wants to set a trap.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d
give anything to see him; she says she requires another tip.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
really quite morbid about it.&nbsp; But she must play fair - she <i>shan&rsquo;t</i>
see him!&rdquo; he emphatically added.&nbsp; I wondered if they hadn&rsquo;t
even quarrelled a little on the subject - a suspicion not corrected
by the way he more than once exclaimed to me: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s quite
incredibly literary, you know - quite fantastically!&rdquo;&nbsp; I
remember his saying of her that she felt in italics and thought in capitals.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh when I&rsquo;ve run him to earth,&rdquo; he also said, &ldquo;then,
you know, I shall knock at his door.&nbsp; Rather - I beg you to believe.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll have it from his own lips: &lsquo;Right you are, my boy;
you&rsquo;ve done it this time!&rsquo;&nbsp; He shall crown me victor
- with the critical laurel.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Meanwhile he really avoided the chances London life might have given
him of meeting the distinguished novelist; a danger, however, that disappeared
with Vereker&rsquo;s leaving England for an indefinite absence, as the
newspapers announced - going to the south for motives connected with
the health of his wife, which had long kept her in retirement.&nbsp;
A year - more than a year - had elapsed since the incident at Bridges,
but I had had no further sight of him.&nbsp; I think I was at bottom
rather ashamed - I hated to remind him that, though I had irremediably
missed his point, a reputation for acuteness was rapidly overtaking
me.&nbsp; This scruple led me a dance; kept me out of Lady Jane&rsquo;s
house, made me even decline, when in spite of my bad manners she was
a second time so good as to make me a sign, an invitation to her beautiful
seat.&nbsp; I once became aware of her under Vereker&rsquo;s escort
at a concert, and was sure I was seen by them, but I slipped out without
being caught.&nbsp; I felt, as on that occasion I splashed along in
the rain, that I couldn&rsquo;t have done anything else; and yet I remember
saying to myself that it was hard, was even cruel.&nbsp; Not only had
I lost the books, but I had lost the man himself: they and their author
had been alike spoiled for me.&nbsp; I knew too which was the loss I
most regretted.&nbsp; I had taken to the man still more than I had ever
taken to the books.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER VI.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Six months after our friend had left England George Corvick, who made
his living by his pen, contracted for a piece of work which imposed
on him an absence of some length and a journey of some difficulty, and
his undertaking of which was much of a surprise to me.&nbsp; His brother-in-law
had become editor of a great provincial paper, and the great provincial
paper, in a fine flight of fancy, had conceived the idea of sending
a &ldquo;special commissioner&rdquo; to India.&nbsp; Special commissioners
had begun, in the &ldquo;metropolitan press,&rdquo; to be the fashion,
and the journal in question must have felt it had passed too long for
a mere country cousin.&nbsp; Corvick had no hand, I knew, for the big
brush of the correspondent, but that was his brother-in-law&rsquo;s
affair, and the fact that a particular task was not in his line was
apt to be with himself exactly a reason for accepting it.&nbsp; He was
prepared to out-Herod the metropolitan press; he took solemn precautions
against priggishness, he exquisitely outraged taste.&nbsp; Nobody ever
knew it - that offended principle was all his own.&nbsp; In addition
to his expenses he was to be conveniently paid, and I found myself able
to help him, for the usual fat book, to a plausible arrangement with
the usual fat publisher.&nbsp; I naturally inferred that his obvious
desire to make a little money was not unconnected with the prospect
of a union with Gwendolen Erme.&nbsp; I was aware that her mother&rsquo;s
opposition was largely addressed to his want of means and of lucrative
abilities, but it so happened that, on my saying the last time I saw
him something that bore on the question of his separation from our young
lady, he brought out with an emphasis that startled me: &ldquo;Ah I&rsquo;m
not a bit engaged to her, you know!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Not overtly,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;because her mother doesn&rsquo;t
like you.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ve always taken for granted a private understanding.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, there <i>was</i> one.&nbsp; But there isn&rsquo;t now.&rdquo;&nbsp;
That was all he said save something about Mrs. Erme&rsquo;s having got
on her feet again in the most extraordinary way - a remark pointing,
as I supposed, the moral that private understandings were of little
use when the doctor didn&rsquo;t share them.&nbsp; What I took the liberty
of more closely inferring was that the girl might in some way have estranged
him.&nbsp; Well, if he had taken the turn of jealousy for instance it
could scarcely be jealousy of me.&nbsp; In that case - over and above
the absurdity of it - he wouldn&rsquo;t have gone away just to leave
us together.&nbsp; For some time before his going we had indulged in
no allusion to the buried treasure, and from his silence, which my reserve
simply emulated, I had drawn a sharp conclusion.&nbsp; His courage had
dropped, his ardour had gone the way of mine - this appearance at least
he left me to scan.&nbsp; More than that he couldn&rsquo;t do; he couldn&rsquo;t
face the triumph with which I might have greeted an explicit admission.&nbsp;
He needn&rsquo;t have been afraid, poor dear, for I had by this time
lost all need to triumph.&nbsp; In fact I considered I showed magnanimity
in not reproaching him with his collapse, for the sense of his having
thrown up the game made me feel more than ever how much I at last depended
on him.&nbsp; If Corvick had broken down I should never know; no one
would be of any use if <i>he</i> wasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t
a bit true I had ceased to care for knowledge; little by little my curiosity
not only had begun to ache again, but had become the familiar torment
of my days and my nights.&nbsp; There are doubtless people to whom torments
of such an order appear hardly more natural than the contortions of
disease; but I don&rsquo;t after all know why I should in this connexion
so much as mention them.&nbsp; For the few persons, at any rate, abnormal
or not, with whom my anecdote is concerned, literature was a game of
skill, and skill meant courage, and courage meant honour, and honour
meant passion, meant life.&nbsp; The stake on the table was of a special
substance and our roulette the revolving mind, but we sat round the
green board as intently as the grim gamblers at Monte Carlo.&nbsp; Gwendolen
Erme, for that matter, with her white face and her fixed eyes, was of
the very type of the lean ladies one had met in the temples of chance.&nbsp;
I recognised in Corvick&rsquo;s absence that she made this analogy vivid.&nbsp;
It was extravagant, I admit, the way she lived for the art of the pen.&nbsp;
Her passion visibly preyed on her, and in her presence I felt almost
tepid.&nbsp; I got hold of &ldquo;Deep Down&rdquo; again: it was a desert
in which she had lost herself, but in which too she had dug a wonderful
hole in the sand - a cavity out of which Corvick had still more remarkably
pulled her.<br>
<br>
Early in March I had a telegram from her, in consequence of which I
repaired immediately to Chelsea, where the first thing she said to me
was: &ldquo;He has got it, he has got it!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
She was moved, as I could see, to such depths that she must mean the
great thing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Vereker&rsquo;s idea?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;His general intention.&nbsp; George has cabled from Bombay.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
She had the missive open there; it was emphatic though concise.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Eureka.&nbsp; Immense.&rdquo;&nbsp; That was all - he had saved
the cost of the signature.&nbsp; I shared her emotion, but I was disappointed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t say what it is.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;How could he - in a telegram?&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll write it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But how does he know?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Know it&rsquo;s the real thing?&nbsp; Oh I&rsquo;m sure that
when you see it you do know.&nbsp; Vera incessu patuit dea!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you, Miss Erme, who are a &lsquo;dear&rsquo; for bringing
me such news!&rdquo; - I went all lengths in my high spirits.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But fancy finding our goddess in the temple of Vishnu!&nbsp;
How strange of George to have been able to go into the thing again in
the midst of such different and such powerful solicitations!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t gone into it, I know; it&rsquo;s the thing itself,
let severely alone for six months, that has simply sprung out at him
like a tigress out of the jungle.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t take a book
with him - on purpose; indeed he wouldn&rsquo;t have needed to - he
knows every page, as I do, by heart.&nbsp; They all worked in him together,
and some day somewhere, when he wasn&rsquo;t thinking, they fell, in
all their superb intricacy, into the one right combination.&nbsp; The
figure in the carpet came out.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the way he knew it
would come and the real reason - you didn&rsquo;t in the least understand,
but I suppose I may tell you now - why he went and why I consented to
his going.&nbsp; We knew the change would do it - that the difference
of thought, of scene, would give the needed touch, the magic shake.&nbsp;
We had perfectly, we had admirably calculated.&nbsp; The elements were
all in his mind, and in the secousse of a new and intense experience
they just struck light.&rdquo;&nbsp; She positively struck light herself
- she was literally, facially luminous.&nbsp; I stammered something
about unconscious cerebration, and she continued: &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
come right home - this will bring him.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;To see Vereker, you mean?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;To see Vereker - and to see <i>me</i>.&nbsp; Think what he&rsquo;ll
have to tell me!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I hesitated.&nbsp; &ldquo;About India?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;About fiddlesticks!&nbsp; About Vereker - about the figure in
the carpet.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But, as you say, we shall surely have that in a letter.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
She thought like one inspired, and I remembered how Corvick had told
me long before that her face was interesting.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps it
can&rsquo;t be got into a letter if it&rsquo;s &lsquo;immense.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Perhaps not if it&rsquo;s immense bosh.&nbsp; If he has hold
of something that can&rsquo;t be got into a letter he hasn&rsquo;t hold
of <i>the</i> thing.&nbsp; Vereker&rsquo;s own statement to me was exactly
that the &lsquo;figure&rsquo; <i>would</i> fit into a letter.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, I cabled to George an hour ago - two words,&rdquo; said
Gwendolen.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Is it indiscreet of me to ask what they were?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
She hung fire, but at last brought them out.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;Angel,
write.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make it sure
- I&rsquo;ll send him the same.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER VII.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
My words however were not absolutely the same - I put something instead
of &ldquo;angel&rdquo;; and in the sequel my epithet seemed the more
apt, for when eventually we heard from our traveller it was merely,
it was thoroughly to be tantalised.&nbsp; He was magnificent in his
triumph, he described his discovery as stupendous; but his ecstasy only
obscured it - there were to be no particulars till he should have submitted
his conception to the supreme authority.&nbsp; He had thrown up his
commission, he had thrown up his book, he had thrown up everything but
the instant need to hurry to Rapallo, on the Genoese shore, where Vereker
was making a stay.&nbsp; I wrote him a letter which was to await him
at Aden - I besought him to relieve my suspense.&nbsp; That he had found
my letter was indicated by a telegram which, reaching me after weary
days and in the absence of any answer to my laconic dispatch to him
at Bombay, was evidently intended as a reply to both communications.&nbsp;
Those few words were in familiar French, the French of the day, which
Covick often made use of to show he wasn&rsquo;t a prig.&nbsp; It had
for some persons the opposite effect, but his message may fairly be
paraphrased.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have patience; I want to see, as it breaks
on you, the face you&rsquo;ll make!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Tellement envie
de voir ta t&ecirc;te!&rdquo; - that was what I had to sit down with.&nbsp;
I can certainly not be said to have sat down, for I seem to remember
myself at this time as rattling constantly between the little house
in Chelsea and my own.&nbsp; Our impatience, Gwendolen&rsquo;s and mine,
was equal, but I kept hoping her light would be greater.&nbsp; We all
spent during this episode, for people of our means, a great deal of
money in telegrams and cabs, and I counted on the receipt of news from
Rapallo immediately after the junction of the discoverer with the discovered.&nbsp;
The interval seemed an age, but late one day I heard a hansom precipitated
to my door with the crash engendered by a hint of liberality.&nbsp;
I lived with my heart in my mouth and accordingly bounded to the window
- a movement which gave me a view of a young lady erect on the footboard
of the vehicle and eagerly looking up at my house.&nbsp; At sight of
me she flourished a paper with a movement that brought me straight down,
the movement with which, in melodramas, handkerchiefs and reprieves
are flourished at the foot of the scaffold.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Just seen Vereker - not a note wrong.&nbsp; Pressed me to bosom
- keeps me a month.&rdquo;&nbsp; So much I read on her paper while the
cabby dropped a grin from his perch.&nbsp; In my excitement I paid him
profusely and in hers she suffered it; then as he drove away we started
to walk about and talk.&nbsp; We had talked, heaven knows, enough before,
but this was a wondrous lift.&nbsp; We pictured the whole scene at Rapallo,
where he would have written, mentioning my name, for permission to call;
that is <i>I</i> pictured it, having more material than my companion,
whom I felt hang on my lips as we stopped on purpose before shop-windows
we didn&rsquo;t look into.&nbsp; About one thing we were clear: if he
was staying on for fuller communication we should at least have a letter
from him that would help us through the dregs of delay.&nbsp; We understood
his staying on, and yet each of us saw, I think, that the other hated
it.&nbsp; The letter we were clear about arrived; it was for Gwendolen,
and I called on her in time to save her the trouble of bringing it to
me.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t read it out, as was natural enough; but she
repeated to me what it chiefly embodied.&nbsp; This consisted of the
remarkable statement that he&rsquo;d tell her after they were married
exactly what she wanted to know.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Only <i>then</i>, when I&rsquo;m his wife - not before,&rdquo;
she explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s tantamount to saying - isn&rsquo;t
it? - that I must marry him straight off!&rdquo;&nbsp; She smiled at
me while I flushed with disappointment, a vision of fresh delay that
made me at first unconscious of my surprise.&nbsp; It seemed more than
a hint that on me as well he would impose some tiresome condition.&nbsp;
Suddenly, while she reported several more things from his letter, I
remembered what he had told me before going away.&nbsp; He had found
Mr. Vereker deliriously interesting and his own possession of the secret
a real intoxication.&nbsp; The buried treasure was all gold and gems.&nbsp;
Now that it was there it seemed to grow and grow before him; it would
have been, through all time and taking all tongues, one of the most
wonderful flowers of literary art.&nbsp; Nothing, in especial, once
you were face to face with it, could show for more consummately <i>done</i>.&nbsp;
When once it came out it came out, was there with a splendour that made
you ashamed; and there hadn&rsquo;t been, save in the bottomless vulgarity
of the age, with every one tasteless and tainted, every sense stopped,
the smallest reason why it should have been overlooked.&nbsp; It was
great, yet so simple, was simple, yet so great, and the final knowledge
of it was an experience quite apart.&nbsp; He intimated that the charm
of such an experience, the desire to drain it, in its freshness, to
the last drop, was what kept him there close to the source.&nbsp; Gwendolen,
frankly radiant as she tossed me these fragments, showed the elation
of a prospect more assured than my own.&nbsp; That brought me back to
the question of her marriage, prompted me to ask if what she meant by
what she had just surprised me with was that she was under an engagement.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Of course I am!&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t
you know it?&rdquo;&nbsp; She seemed astonished, but I was still more
so, for Corvick had told me the exact contrary.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t
mention this, however; I only reminded her how little I had been on
that score in her confidence, or even in Corvick&rsquo;s, and that,
moreover I wasn&rsquo;t in ignorance of her mother&rsquo;s interdict.&nbsp;
At bottom I was troubled by the disparity of the two accounts; but after
a little I felt Corvick&rsquo;s to be the one I least doubted.&nbsp;
This simply reduced me to asking myself if the girl had on the spot
improvised an engagement - vamped up an old one or dashed off a new
- in order to arrive at the satisfaction she desired.&nbsp; She must
have had resources of which I was destitute, but she made her case slightly
more intelligible by returning presently: &ldquo;What the state of things
has been is that we felt of course bound to do nothing in mamma&rsquo;s
lifetime.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But now you think you&rsquo;ll just dispense with mamma&rsquo;s
consent?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ah it mayn&rsquo;t come to that!&rdquo;&nbsp; I wondered what
it might come to, and she went on: &ldquo;Poor dear, she may swallow
the dose.&nbsp; In fact, you know,&rdquo; she added with a laugh, &ldquo;she
really <i>must</i>!&rdquo; - a proposition of which, on behalf of every
one concerned, I fully acknowledged the force.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER VIII.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Nothing more vexatious had ever happened to me than to become aware
before Corvick&rsquo;s arrival in England that I shouldn&rsquo;t be
there to put him through.&nbsp; I found myself abruptly called to Germany
by the alarming illness of my younger brother, who, against my advice,
had gone to Munich to study, at the feet indeed of a great master, the
art of portraiture in oils.&nbsp; The near relative who made him an
allowance had threatened to withdraw it if he should, under specious
pretexts, turn for superior truth to Paris - Paris being somehow, for
a Cheltenham aunt, the school of evil, the abyss.&nbsp; I deplored this
prejudice at the time, and the deep injury of it was now visible - first
in the fact that it hadn&rsquo;t saved the poor boy, who was clever,
frail and foolish, from congestion of the lungs, and second in the greater
break with London to which the event condemned me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid
that what was uppermost in my mind during several anxious weeks was
the sense that if we had only been in Paris I might have run over to
see Corvick.&nbsp; This was actually out of the question from every
point of view: my brother, whose recovery gave us both plenty to do,
was ill for three months, during which I never left him and at the end
of which we had to face the absolute prohibition of a return to England.&nbsp;
The consideration of climate imposed itself, and he was in no state
to meet it alone.&nbsp; I took him to Meran and there spent the summer
with him, trying to show him by example how to get back to work and
nursing a rage of another sort that I tried <i>not</i> to show him.<br>
<br>
The whole business proved the first of a series of phenomena so strangely
interlaced that, taken together - which was how I had to take them -
they form as good an illustration as I can recall of the manner in which,
for the good of his soul doubtless, fate sometimes deals with a man&rsquo;s
avidity.&nbsp; These incidents certainly had larger bearings than the
comparatively meagre consequence we are here concerned with - though
I feel that consequence also a thing to speak of with some respect.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s mainly in such a light, I confess, at any rate, that the
ugly fruit of my exile is at this hour present to me.&nbsp; Even at
first indeed the spirit in which my avidity, as I have called it, made
me regard that term owed no element of ease to the fact that before
coming back from Rapallo George Corvick addressed me in a way I objected
to.&nbsp; His letter had none of the sedative action I must to-day profess
myself sure he had wished to give it, and the march of occurrences was
not so ordered as to make up for what it lacked.&nbsp; He had begun
on the spot, for one of the quarterlies, a great last word on Vereker&rsquo;s
writings, and this exhaustive study, the only one that would have counted,
have existed, was to turn on the new light, to utter - oh, so quietly!
- the unimagined truth.&nbsp; It was in other words to trace the figure
in the carpet through every convolution, to reproduce it in every tint.&nbsp;
The result, according to my friend, would be the greatest literary portrait
ever painted, and what he asked of me was just to be so good as not
to trouble him with questions till he should hang up his masterpiece
before me.&nbsp; He did me the honour to declare that, putting aside
the great sitter himself, all aloft in his indifference, I was individually
the connoisseur he was most working for.&nbsp; I was therefore to be
a good boy and not try to peep under the curtain before the show was
ready: I should enjoy it all the more if I sat very still.<br>
<br>
I did my best to sit very still, but I couldn&rsquo;t help giving a
jump on seeing in <i>The Times</i>, after I had been a week or two in
Munich and before, as I knew, Corvick had reached London, the announcement
of the sudden death of poor Mrs. Erme.&nbsp; I instantly, by letter,
appealed to Gwendolen for particulars, and she wrote me that her mother
had yielded to long-threatened failure of the heart.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t
say, but I took the liberty of reading into her words, that from the
point of view of her marriage and also of her eagerness, which was quite
a match for mine, this was a solution more prompt than could have been
expected and more radical than waiting for the old lady to swallow the
dose.&nbsp; I candidly admit indeed that at the time - for I heard from
her repeatedly - I read some singular things into Gwendolen&rsquo;s
words and some still more extraordinary ones into her silences.&nbsp;
Pen in hand, this way, I live the time over, and it brings back the
oddest sense of my having been, both for months and in spite of myself,
a kind of coerced spectator.&nbsp; All my life had taken refuge in my
eyes, which the procession of events appeared to have committed itself
to keep astare.&nbsp; There were days when I thought of writing to Hugh
Vereker and simply throwing myself on his charity.&nbsp; But I felt
more deeply that I hadn&rsquo;t fallen quite so low - besides which,
quite properly, he would send me about my business.&nbsp; Mrs. Erme&rsquo;s
death brought Corvick straight home, and within the month he was united
&ldquo;very quietly&rdquo; - as quietly, I seemed to make out, as he
meant in his article to bring out his trouvaille - to the young lady
he had loved and quitted.&nbsp; I use this last term, I may parenthetically
say, because I subsequently grew sure that at the time he went to India,
at the time of his great news from Bombay, there had been no positive
pledge between them whatever.&nbsp; There had been none at the moment
she was affirming to me the very opposite.&nbsp; On the other hand he
had certainly become engaged the day he returned.&nbsp; The happy pair
went down to Torquay for their honeymoon, and there, in a reckless hour,
it occurred to poor Corvick to take his young bride a drive.&nbsp; He
had no command of that business: this had been brought home to me of
old in a little tour we had once made together in a dogcart.&nbsp; In
a dogcart he perched his companion for a rattle over Devonshire hills,
on one of the likeliest of which he brought his horse, who, it was true,
had bolted, down with such violence that the occupants of the cart were
hurled forward and that he fell horribly on his head.&nbsp; He was killed
on the spot; Gwendolen escaped unhurt.<br>
<br>
I pass rapidly over the question of this unmitigated tragedy, of what
the loss of my best friend meant for me, and I complete my little history
of my patience and my pain by the frank statement of my having, in a
postscript to my very first letter to her after the receipt of the hideous
news, asked Mrs. Corvick whether her husband mightn&rsquo;t at least
have finished the great article on Vereker.&nbsp; Her answer was as
prompt as my question: the article, which had been barely begun, was
a mere heartbreaking scrap.&nbsp; She explained that our friend, abroad,
had just settled down to it when interrupted by her mother&rsquo;s death,
and that then, on his return, he had been kept from work by the engrossments
into which that calamity was to plunge them.&nbsp; The opening pages
were all that existed; they were striking, they were promising, but
they didn&rsquo;t unveil the idol.&nbsp; That great intellectual feat
was obviously to have formed his climax.&nbsp; She said nothing more,
nothing to enlighten me as to the state of her own knowledge - the knowledge
for the acquisition of which I had fancied her prodigiously acting.&nbsp;
This was above all what I wanted to know: had <i>she</i> seen the idol
unveiled?&nbsp; Had there been a private ceremony for a palpitating
audience of one?&nbsp; For what else but that ceremony had the nuptials
taken place?&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t like as yet to press her, though when
I thought of what had passed between us on the subject in Corvick&rsquo;s
absence her reticence surprised me.&nbsp; It was therefore not till
much later, from Meran, that I risked another appeal, risked it in some
trepidation, for she continued to tell me nothing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did
you hear in those few days of your blighted bliss,&rdquo; I wrote, &ldquo;what
we desired so to hear?&rdquo;&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;we,&rdquo; as a little
hint and she showed me she could take a little hint; &ldquo;I heard
everything,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and I mean to keep it to myself!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER IX.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It was impossible not to be moved with the strongest sympathy for her,
and on my return to England I showed her every kindness in my power.&nbsp;
Her mother&rsquo;s death had made her means sufficient, and she had
gone to live in a more convenient quarter.&nbsp; But her loss had been
great and her visitation cruel; it never would have occurred to me moreover
to suppose she could come to feel the possession of a technical tip,
of a piece of literary experience, a counterpoise to her grief.&nbsp;
Strange to say, none the less, I couldn&rsquo;t help believing after
I had seen her a few times that I caught a glimpse of some such oddity.&nbsp;
I hasten to add that there had been other things I couldn&rsquo;t help
believing, or at least imagining; and as I never felt I was really clear
about these, so, as to the point I here touch on, I give her memory
the benefit of the doubt.&nbsp; Stricken and solitary, highly accomplished
and now, in her deep mourning, her maturer grace and her uncomplaining
sorrow, incontestably handsome, she presented herself as leading a life
of singular dignity and beauty.&nbsp; I had at first found a way to
persuade myself that I should soon get the better of the reserve formulated,
the week after the catastrophe in her reply to an appeal as to which
I was not unconscious that it might strike her as mistimed.&nbsp; Certainly
that reserve was something of a shock to me - certainly it puzzled me
the more I thought of it and even though I tried to explain it (with
moments of success) by an imputation of exalted sentiments, of superstitious
scruples, of a refinement of loyalty.&nbsp; Certainly it added at the
same time hugely to the price of Vereker&rsquo;s secret, precious as
this mystery already appeared.&nbsp; I may as well confess abjectly
that Mrs. Corvick&rsquo;s unexpected attitude was the final tap on the
nail that was to fix fast my luckless idea, convert it into the obsession
of which I&rsquo;m for ever conscious.<br>
<br>
But this only helped me the more to be artful, to be adroit, to allow
time to elapse before renewing my suit.&nbsp; There were plenty of speculations
for the interval, and one of them was deeply absorbing.&nbsp; Corvick
had kept his information from his young friend till after the removal
of the last barrier to their intimacy - then only had he let the cat
out of the bag.&nbsp; Was it Gwendolen&rsquo;s idea, taking a hint from
him, to liberate this animal only on the basis of the renewal of such
a relation?&nbsp; Was the figure in the carpet traceable or describable
only for husbands and wives - for lovers supremely united?&nbsp; It
came back to me in a mystifying manner that in Kensington Square, when
I mentioned that Corvick would have told the girl he loved, some word
had dropped from Vereker that gave colour to this possibility.&nbsp;
There might be little in it, but there was enough to make me wonder
if I should have to marry Mrs. Corvick to get what I wanted.&nbsp; Was
I prepared to offer her this price for the blessing of her knowledge?&nbsp;
Ah that way madness lay! - so I at least said to myself in bewildered
hours.&nbsp; I could see meanwhile the torch she refused to pass on
flame away in her chamber of memory - pour through her eyes a light
that shone in her lonely house.&nbsp; At the end of six months I was
fully sure of what this warm presence made up to her for.&nbsp; We had
talked again and again of the man who had brought us together - of his
talent, his character, his personal charm, his certain career, his dreadful
doom, and even of his clear purpose in that great study which was to
have been a supreme literary portrait, a kind of critical Vandyke or
Velasquez.&nbsp; She had conveyed to me in abundance that she was tongue-tied
by her perversity, by her piety, that she would never break the silence
it had not been given to the &ldquo;right person,&rdquo; as she said,
to break.&nbsp; The hour however finally arrived.&nbsp; One evening
when I had been sitting with her longer than usual I laid my hand firmly
on her arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now at last what <i>is</i> it?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
She had been expecting me and was ready.&nbsp; She gave a long slow
soundless headshake, merciful only in being inarticulate.&nbsp; This
mercy didn&rsquo;t prevent its hurling at me the largest finest coldest
&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; I had yet, in the course of a life that had known
denials, had to take full in the face.&nbsp; I took it and was aware
that with the hard blow the tears had come into my eyes.&nbsp; So for
a while we sat and looked at each other; after which I slowly rose,
I was wondering if some day she would accept me; but this was not what
I brought out.&nbsp; I said as I smoothed down my hat: &ldquo;I know
what to think then.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s nothing!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
A remote disdainful pity for me gathered in her dim smile; then she
spoke in a voice that I hear at this hour: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my <i>life</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp;
As I stood at the door she added: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve insulted him!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Do you mean Vereker?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I mean the Dead!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I recognised when I reached the street the justice of her charge.&nbsp;
Yes, it was her life - I recognised that too; but her life none the
less made room with the lapse of time for another interest.&nbsp; A
year and a half after Corvick&rsquo;s death she published in a single
volume her second novel, &ldquo;Overmastered,&rdquo; which I pounced
on in the hope of finding in it some tell-tale echo or some peeping
face.&nbsp; All I found was a much better book than her younger performance,
showing I thought the better company she had kept.&nbsp; As a tissue
tolerably intricate it was a carpet with a figure of its own; but the
figure was not the figure I was looking for.&nbsp; On sending a review
of it to <i>The Middle</i> I was surprised to learn from the office
that a notice was already in type.&nbsp; When the paper came out I had
no hesitation in attributing this article, which I thought rather vulgarly
overdone, to Drayton Deane, who in the old days had been something of
a friend of Corvick&rsquo;s, yet had only within a few weeks made the
acquaintance of his widow.&nbsp; I had had an early copy of the book,
but Deane had evidently had an earlier.&nbsp; He lacked all the same
the light hand with which Corvick had gilded the gingerbread - he laid
on the tinsel in splotches.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER X.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Six months later appeared &ldquo;The Right of Way,&rdquo; the last chance,
though we didn&rsquo;t know it, that we were to have to redeem ourselves.&nbsp;
Written wholly during Vereker&rsquo;s sojourn abroad, the book had been
heralded, in a hundred paragraphs, by the usual ineptitudes.&nbsp; I
carried it, as early a copy as any, I this time flattered myself, straightway
to Mrs. Corvick.&nbsp; This was the only use I had for it; I left the
inevitable tribute of <i>The</i> <i>Middle</i> to some more ingenious
mind and some less irritated temper.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I already have
it,&rdquo; Gwendolen said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Drayton Deane was so good as
to bring it to me yesterday, and I&rsquo;ve just finished it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yesterday?&nbsp; How did he get it so soon?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;He gets everything so soon!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s to review it in
<i>The Middle</i>.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;He - Drayton Deane - review Vereker?&rdquo;&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t
believe my ears.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Why not?&nbsp; One fine ignorance is as good as another.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I winced but I presently said: &ldquo;You ought to review him yourself!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t &lsquo;review,&rsquo;&rdquo; she laughed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m reviewed!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Just then the door was thrown open.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah yes, here&rsquo;s
your reviewer!&rdquo;&nbsp; Drayton Deane was there with his long legs
and his tall forehead: he had come to see what she thought of &ldquo;The
Right of Way,&rdquo; and to bring news that was singularly relevant.&nbsp;
The evening papers were just out with a telegram on the author of that
work, who, in Rome, had been ill for some days with an attack of malarial
fever.&nbsp; It had at first not been thought grave, but had taken,
in consequence of complications, a turn that might give rise to anxiety.&nbsp;
Anxiety had indeed at the latest hour begun to be felt.<br>
<br>
I was struck in the presence of these tidings with the fundamental detachment
that Mrs. Corvick&rsquo;s overt concern quite failed to hide: it gave
me the measure of her consummate independence.&nbsp; That independence
rested on her knowledge, the knowledge which nothing now could destroy
and which nothing could make different.&nbsp; The figure in the carpet
might take on another twist or two, but the sentence had virtually been
written.&nbsp; The writer might go down to his grave: she was the person
in the world to whom - as if she had been his favoured heir - his continued
existence was least of a need.&nbsp; This reminded me how I had observed
at a particular moment - after Corvick&rsquo;s death - the drop of her
desire to see him face to face.&nbsp; She had got what she wanted without
that.&nbsp; I had been sure that if she hadn&rsquo;t got it she wouldn&rsquo;t
have been restrained from the endeavour to sound him personally by those
superior reflexions, more conceivable on a man&rsquo;s part than on
a woman&rsquo;s, which in my case had served an a deterrent.&nbsp; It
wasn&rsquo;t however, I hasten to add, that my case, in spite of this
invidious comparison, wasn&rsquo;t ambiguous enough.&nbsp; At the thought
that Vereker was perhaps at that moment dying there rolled over me a
wave of anguish - a poignant sense of how inconsistently I still depended
on him.&nbsp; A delicacy that it was my one compensation to suffer to
rule me had left the Alps and the Apennines between us, but the sense
of the waning occasion suggested that I might in my despair at last
have gone to him.&nbsp; Of course I should really have done nothing
of the sort.&nbsp; I remained five minutes, while my companions talked
of the new book, and when Drayton Deane appealed to me for my opinion
of it I made answer, getting up, that I detested Hugh Vereker and simply
couldn&rsquo;t read him.&nbsp; I departed with the moral certainty that
as the door closed behind me Deane would brand me for awfully superficial.&nbsp;
His hostess wouldn&rsquo;t contradict <i>that</i> at least.<br>
<br>
I continue to trace with a briefer touch our intensely odd successions.&nbsp;
Three weeks after this came Vereker&rsquo;s death, and before the year
was out the death of his wife.&nbsp; That poor lady I had never seen,
but I had had a futile theory that, should she survive him long enough
to be decorously accessible, I might approach her with the feeble flicker
of my plea.&nbsp; Did she know and if she knew would she speak?&nbsp;
It was much to be presumed that for more reasons than one she would
have nothing to say; but when she passed out of all reach I felt renannouncement
indeed my appointed lot.&nbsp; I was shut up in my obsession for ever
- my gaolers had gone off with the key.&nbsp; I find myself quite as
vague as a captive in a dungeon about the tinge that further elapsed
before Mrs. Corvick became the wife of Drayton Deane.&nbsp; I had foreseen,
through my bars, this end of the business, though there was no indecent
haste and our friendship had fallen rather off.&nbsp; They were both
so &ldquo;awfully intellectual&rdquo; that it struck people as a suitable
match, but I had measured better than any one the wealth of understanding
the bride would contribute to the union.&nbsp; Never, for a marriage
in literary circles - so the newspapers described the alliance - had
a lady been so bravely dowered.&nbsp; I began with due promptness to
look for the fruit of the affair - that fruit, I mean, of which the
premonitory symptoms would be peculiarly visible in the husband.&nbsp;
Taking for granted the splendour of the other party&rsquo;s nuptial
gift, I expected to see him make a show commensurate with his increase
of means.&nbsp; I knew what his means had been - his article on &ldquo;The
Right of Way&rdquo; had distinctly given one the figure.&nbsp; As he
was now exactly in the position in which still more exactly I was not
I watched from month to month, in the likely periodicals, for the heavy
message poor Corvick had been unable to deliver and the responsibility
of which would have fallen on his successor.&nbsp; The widow and wife
would have broken by the rekindled hearth the silence that only a widow
and wife might break, and Deane would be as aflame with the knowledge
as Corvick in his own hour, as Gwendolen in hers, had been.&nbsp; Well,
he was aflame doubtless, but the fire was apparently not to become a
public blaze.&nbsp; I scanned the periodicals in vain: Drayton Deane
filled them with exuberant pages, but he withheld the page I most feverishly
sought.&nbsp; He wrote on a thousand subjects, but never on the subject
of Vereker.&nbsp; His special line was to tell truths that other people
either &ldquo;funked,&rdquo; as he said, or overlooked, but he never
told the only truth that seemed to me in these days to signify.&nbsp;
I met the couple in those literary circles referred to in the papers:
I have sufficiently intimated that it was only in such circles we were
all constructed to revolve.&nbsp; Gwendolen was more than ever committed
to them by the publication of her third novel, and I myself definitely
classed by holding the opinion that this work was inferior to its immediate
predecessor.&nbsp; Was it worse because she had been keeping worse company?&nbsp;
If her secret was, as she had told me, her life - a fact discernible
in her increasing bloom, an air of conscious privilege that, cleverly
corrected by pretty charities, gave distinction to her appearance -
it had yet not a direct influence on her work.&nbsp; That only made
one - everything only made one - yearn the more for it; only rounded
it off with a mystery finer and subtler.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XI.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It was therefore from her husband I could never remove my eyes: I beset
him in a manner that might have made him uneasy.&nbsp; I went even so
far as to engage him in conversation.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t he know, hadn&rsquo;t
he come into it as a matter of course? - that question hummed in my
brain.&nbsp; Of course he knew; otherwise he wouldn&rsquo;t return my
stare so queerly.&nbsp; His wife had told him what I wanted and he was
amiably amused at my impotence.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t laugh - he wasn&rsquo;t
a laugher: his system was to present to my irritation, so that I should
crudely expose myself, a conversational blank as vast as his big bare
brow.&nbsp; It always happened that I turned away with a settled conviction
from these unpeopled expanses, which seemed to complete each other geographically
and to symbolise together Drayton Deane&rsquo;s want of voice, want
of form.&nbsp; He simply hadn&rsquo;t the art to use what he knew; he
literally was incompetent to take up the duty where Corvick had left
it.&nbsp; I went still further - it was the only glimpse of happiness
I had.&nbsp; I made up my mind that the duty didn&rsquo;t appeal to
him.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t interested, he didn&rsquo;t care.&nbsp; Yes,
it quite comforted me to believe him too stupid to have joy of the thing
I lacked.&nbsp; He was as stupid after as he had been before, and that
deepened for me the golden glory in which the mystery was wrapped.&nbsp;
I had of course none the less to recollect that his wife might have
imposed her conditions and exactions.&nbsp; I had above all to remind
myself that with Vereker&rsquo;s death the major incentive dropped.&nbsp;
He was still there to be honoured by what might be done - he was no
longer there to give it his sanction.&nbsp; Who alas but he had the
authority?<br>
<br>
Two children were born to the pair, but the second cost the mother her
life.&nbsp; After this stroke I seemed to see another ghost of a chance.&nbsp;
I jumped at it in thought, but I waited a certain time for manners,
and at last my opportunity arrived in a remunerative way.&nbsp; His
wife had been dead a year when I met Drayton Deane in the smoking-room
of a small club of which we both were members, but where for months
- perhaps because I rarely entered it - I hadn&rsquo;t seen him.&nbsp;
The room was empty and the occasion propitious.&nbsp; I deliberately
offered him, to have done with the matter for ever, that advantage for
which I felt he had long been looking.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;As an older acquaintance of your late wife&rsquo;s than even
you were,&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;you must let me say to you something
I have on my mind.&nbsp; I shall be glad to make any terms with you
that you see fit to name for the information she must have had from
George Corvick - the information you know, that had come to him, poor
chap, in one of the happiest hours of his life, straight from Hugh Vereker.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He looked at me like a dim phrenological bust.&nbsp; &ldquo;The information
- ?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Vereker&rsquo;s secret, my dear man - the general intention of
his books: the string the pearls were strung on, the buried treasure,
the figure in the carpet.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He began to flush - the numbers on his bumps to come out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Vereker&rsquo;s
books had a general intention?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I stared in my turn.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you don&rsquo;t
know it?&rdquo;&nbsp; I thought for a moment he was playing with me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mrs. Deane knew it; she had it, as I say, straight from Corvick,
who had, after infinite search and to Vereker&rsquo;s own delight, found
the very mouth of the cave.&nbsp; Where <i>is</i> the mouth?&nbsp; He
told after their marriage - and told alone - the person who, when the
circumstances were reproduced, must have told you.&nbsp; Have I been
wrong in taking for granted that she admitted you, as one of the highest
privileges of the relation in which you stood to her, to the knowledge
of which she was after Corvick&rsquo;s death the sole depositary?&nbsp;
All I know is that that knowledge is infinitely precious, and what I
want you to understand is that if you&rsquo;ll in your turn admit me
to it you&rsquo;ll do me a kindness for which I shall be lastingly grateful.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He had turned at last very red; I dare say he had begun by thinking
I had lost my wits.&nbsp; Little by little he followed me; on my own
side I stared with a livelier surprise.&nbsp; Then he spoke. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He wasn&rsquo;t acting - it was the absurd truth.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;She <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> tell you - ?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Nothing about Hugh Vereker.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I was stupefied; the room went round.&nbsp; It had been too good even
for that!&nbsp; &ldquo;Upon your honour?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Upon my honour.&nbsp; What the devil&rsquo;s the matter with
you?&rdquo; he growled.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m astounded - I&rsquo;m disappointed.&nbsp; I wanted
to get it out of you.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t in me!&rdquo; he awkwardly laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
even if it were - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;If it were you&rsquo;d let me have it - oh yes, in common humanity.&nbsp;
But I believe you.&nbsp; I see - I see!&rdquo; I went on, conscious,
with the full turn of the wheel, of my great delusion, my false view
of the poor man&rsquo;s attitude.&nbsp; What I saw, though I couldn&rsquo;t
say it, was that his wife hadn&rsquo;t thought him worth enlightening.&nbsp;
This struck me as strange for a woman who had thought him worth marrying.&nbsp;
At last I explained it by the reflexion that she couldn&rsquo;t possibly
have married him for his understanding.&nbsp; She had married him for
something else.<br>
<br>
He was to some extent enlightened now, but he was even more astonished,
more disconcerted: he took a moment to compare my story with his quickened
memories.&nbsp; The result of his meditation was his presently saying
with a good deal of rather feeble form: &ldquo;This is the first I hear
of what you allude to.&nbsp; I think you must be mistaken as to Mrs.
Drayton Deane&rsquo;s having had any unmentioned, and still less any
unmentionable, knowledge of Hugh Vereker.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d certainly
have wished it - should it have borne on his literary character - to
be used.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It was used.&nbsp; She used it herself.&nbsp; She told me with
her own lips that she &lsquo;lived&rsquo; on it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I had no sooner spoken than I repented of my words; he grew so pale
that I felt as if I had struck him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, &lsquo;lived&rsquo;
-&nbsp; !&rdquo; he murmured, turning short away from me.<br>
<br>
My compunction was real; I laid my hand on his shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
beg you to forgive me - I&rsquo;ve made a mistake.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t
know what I thought you knew.&nbsp; You could, if I had been right,
have rendered me a service; and I had my reasons for assuming that you&rsquo;d
be in a position to meet me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Your reasons?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;What were your reasons?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I looked at him well; I hesitated; I considered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come and
sit down with me here, and I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;&nbsp; I drew
him to a sofa, I lighted another cigar and, beginning with the anecdote
of Vereker&rsquo;s one descent from the clouds, I recited to him the
extraordinary chain of accidents that had, in spite of the original
gleam, kept me till that hour in the dark.&nbsp; I told him in a word
just what I&rsquo;ve written out here.&nbsp; He listened with deepening
attention, and I became aware, to my surprise, by his ejaculations,
by his questions, that he would have been after all not unworthy to
be trusted by his wife.&nbsp; So abrupt an experience of her want of
trust had now a disturbing effect on him; but I saw the immediate shock
throb away little by little and then gather again into waves of wonder
and curiosity - waves that promised, I could perfectly judge, to break
in the end with the fury of my own highest tides.&nbsp; I may say that
to-day as victims of unappeased desire there isn&rsquo;t a pin to choose
between us.&nbsp; The poor man&rsquo;s state is almost my consolation;
there are really moments when I feel it to be quite my revenge.<br>

******This file should be named fgcpt10h.htm or fgcpt10h.zip******

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

Or /etext03, 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
