description: "\"The Figure in the Carpet\" is a short story published in 1896 in London,\
  \ by American writer Henry James. The short story is usually referred to as a novella\
  \ and is told in the first person. The narrator, whose name is never revealed, meets\
  \ his favorite author and becomes obsessed with discovering the secret meaning or\
  \ intention within all the author's works.\nHeretofore, “The Figure in the Carpet”\
  \ has evaded definitive interpretation. In his book Henry James (1913), Ford Madox\
  \ Ford wrote that after the nouvelle was published, James’ contemporaries had set\
  \ themselves on a quest to locate the Figure as an identifiable physical entity.\
  \ In the preface to his Choice of Kipling’s Verse (1941), T.S. Eliot wrote, “Nowadays,\
  \ we all look for the Figure in the Carpet.” Absent a definitive interpretation,\
  \ it opened new possibilities for the study of ambiguity in literature.\n\n\n From\
