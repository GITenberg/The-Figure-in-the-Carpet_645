<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">had</span> done a few things and earned
a few pence&mdash;I had perhaps even had time to begin to think I
was finer than was perceived by the patronising; but when I take
the little measure of my course (a fidgety habit, for it&rsquo;s
none of the longest yet) I count my real start from the evening
George Corvick, breathless and worried, came in to ask me a
service.&nbsp; He had done more things than I, and earned more
pence, though there were chances for cleverness I thought he
sometimes missed.&nbsp; I could only however that evening declare
to him that he never missed one for kindness.&nbsp; There was
almost rapture in hearing it proposed to me to prepare for <i>The
Middle</i>, the organ of our lucubrations, so called from the
position in the week of its day of appearance, an article for
which he had made himself responsible and of which, tied up with
a stout string, he laid on my table the subject.&nbsp; I pounced
upon my opportunity&mdash;that is on the first volume of
it&mdash;and paid scant attention to my friend&rsquo;s
explanation of his appeal.&nbsp; What explanation could be more
to the point than my obvious fitness for the task?&nbsp; I had
written on Hugh Vereker, but never a word in <i>The Middle</i>,
where my dealings were mainly with the ladies and the minor
poets.&nbsp; This was his new novel, an advance copy, and
whatever much or little it should do for his reputation I was
clear on the spot as to what it should do for mine.&nbsp;
Moreover if I always read him as soon as I could get hold of him
I had a particular reason for wishing to read him now: I had
accepted an invitation to Bridges for the following Sunday, and
it had been mentioned in Lady Jane&rsquo;s note that Mr. Vereker
was to be there.&nbsp; I was young enough for a flutter at
meeting a man of his renown, and innocent enough to believe the
occasion would demand the display of an acquaintance with his
&ldquo;last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corvick, who had promised a review of it, had not even had
time to read it; he had gone to pieces in consequence of news
requiring&mdash;as on precipitate reflexion he judged&mdash;that
he should catch the night-mail to Paris.&nbsp; He had had a
telegram from Gwendolen Erme in answer to his letter offering to
fly to her aid.&nbsp; I knew already about Gwendolen Erme; I had
never seen her, but I had my ideas, which were mainly to the
effect that Corvick would marry her if her mother would only
die.&nbsp; That lady seemed now in a fair way to oblige him;
after some dreadful mistake about a climate or a
&ldquo;cure&rdquo; she had suddenly collapsed on the return from
abroad.&nbsp; Her daughter, unsupported and alarmed, desiring to
make a rush for home but hesitating at the risk, had accepted our
friend&rsquo;s assistance, and it was my secret belief that at
sight of him Mrs. Erme would pull round.&nbsp; His own belief was
scarcely to be called secret; it discernibly at any rate differed
from mine.&nbsp; He had showed me Gwendolen&rsquo;s photograph
with the remark that she wasn&rsquo;t pretty but was awfully
interesting; she had published at the age of nineteen a novel in
three volumes, &ldquo;Deep Down,&rdquo; about which, in <i>The
Middle</i>, he had been really splendid.&nbsp; He appreciated my
present eagerness and undertook that the periodical in question
should do no less; then at the last, with his hand on the door,
he said to me: &ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;ll be all right, you
know.&rdquo;&nbsp; Seeing I was a trifle vague he added: &ldquo;I
mean you won&rsquo;t be silly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silly&mdash;about Vereker!&nbsp; Why what do I ever
find him but awfully clever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s that but silly?&nbsp; What on earth
does &lsquo;awfully clever&rsquo; mean?&nbsp; For God&rsquo;s
sake try to get <i>at</i> him.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let him suffer
by our arrangement.&nbsp; Speak of him, you know, if you can, as
<i>I</i> should have spoken of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wondered an instant.&nbsp; &ldquo;You mean as far and away
the biggest of the lot&mdash;that sort of thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corvick almost groaned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh you know, I
don&rsquo;t put them back to back that way; it&rsquo;s the
infancy of art!&nbsp; But he gives me a pleasure so rare; the
sense of&rdquo;&mdash;he mused a little&mdash;&ldquo;something or
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wondered again.&nbsp; &ldquo;The sense, pray, of
want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear man, that&rsquo;s just what I want <i>you</i>
to say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even before he had banged the door I had begun, book in hand,
to prepare myself to say it.&nbsp; I sat up with Vereker half the
night; Corvick couldn&rsquo;t have done more than that.&nbsp; He
was awfully clever&mdash;I stuck to that, but he wasn&rsquo;t a
bit the biggest of the lot.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t allude to the
lot, however; I flattered myself that I emerged on this occasion
from the infancy of art.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all
right,&rdquo; they declared vividly at the office; and when the
number appeared I felt there was a basis on which I could meet
the great man.&nbsp; It gave me confidence for a day or
two&mdash;then that confidence dropped.&nbsp; I had fancied him
reading it with relish, but if Corvick wasn&rsquo;t satisfied how
could Vereker himself be?&nbsp; I reflected indeed that the heat
of the admirer was sometimes grosser even than the appetite of
the scribe.&nbsp; Corvick at all events wrote me from Paris a
little ill-humouredly.&nbsp; Mrs. Erme was pulling round, and I
hadn&rsquo;t at all said what Vereker gave him the sense of.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> effect of my visit to Bridges
was to turn me out for more profundity.&nbsp; Hugh Vereker, as I
saw him there, was of a contact so void of angles that I blushed
for the poverty of imagination involved in my small
precautions.&nbsp; If he was in spirits it wasn&rsquo;t because
he had read my review; in fact on the Sunday morning I felt sure
he hadn&rsquo;t read it, though <i>The Middle</i> had been out
three days and bloomed, I assured myself, in the stiff garden of
periodicals which gave one of the ormolu tables the air of a
stand at a station.&nbsp; The impression he made on me personally
was such that I wished him to read it, and I corrected to this
end with a surreptitious hand what might be wanting in the
careless conspicuity of the sheet.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid I even
watched the result of my man&oelig;uvre, but up to luncheon I
watched in vain.</p>
<p>When afterwards, in the course of our gregarious walk, I found
myself for half an hour, not perhaps without another
man&oelig;uvre, at the great man&rsquo;s side, the result of his
affability was a still livelier desire that he shouldn&rsquo;t
remain in ignorance of the peculiar justice I had done him.&nbsp;
It wasn&rsquo;t that he seemed to thirst for justice; on the
contrary I hadn&rsquo;t yet caught in his talk the faintest grunt
of a grudge&mdash;a note for which my young experience had
already given me an ear.&nbsp; Of late he had had more
recognition, and it was pleasant, as we used to say in <i>The
Middle</i>, to see how it drew him out.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t of
course popular, but I judged one of the sources of his good
humour to be precisely that his success was independent of
that.&nbsp; He had none the less become in a manner the fashion;
the critics at least had put on a spurt and caught up with
him.&nbsp; We had found out at last how clever he was, and he had
had to make the best of the loss of his mystery.&nbsp; I was
strongly tempted, as I walked beside him, to let him know how
much of that unveiling was my act; and there was a moment when I
probably should have done so had not one of the ladies of our
party, snatching a place at his other elbow, just then appealed
to him in a spirit comparatively selfish.&nbsp; It was very
discouraging: I almost felt the liberty had been taken with
myself.</p>
<p>I had had on my tongue&rsquo;s end, for my own part, a phrase
or two about the right word at the right time; but later on I was
glad not to have spoken, for when on our return we clustered at
tea I perceived Lady Jane, who had not been out with us,
brandishing <i>The Middle</i> with her longest arm.&nbsp; She had
taken it up at her leisure; she was delighted with what she had
found, and I saw that, as a mistake in a man may often be a
felicity in a woman, she would practically do for me what I
hadn&rsquo;t been able to do for myself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some sweet
little truths that needed to be spoken,&rdquo; I heard her
declare, thrusting the paper at rather a bewildered couple by the
fireplace.&nbsp; She grabbed it away from them again on the
reappearance of Hugh Vereker, who after our walk had been
upstairs to change something.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t
in general look at this kind of thing, but it&rsquo;s an occasion
really for doing so.&nbsp; You <i>haven&rsquo;t</i> seen
it?&nbsp; Then you must.&nbsp; The man has actually got <i>at</i>
you, at what <i>I</i> always feel, you know.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lady
Jane threw into her eyes a look evidently intended to give an
idea of what she always felt; but she added that she
couldn&rsquo;t have expressed it.&nbsp; The man in the paper
expressed it in a striking manner.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just see there,
and there, where I&rsquo;ve dashed it, how he brings it
out.&rdquo;&nbsp; She had literally marked for him the brightest
patches of my prose, and if I was a little amused Vereker himself
may well have been.&nbsp; He showed how much he was when before
us all Lady Jane wanted to read something aloud.&nbsp; I liked at
any rate the way he defeated her purpose by jerking the paper
affectionately out of her clutch.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d take it
upstairs with him and look at it on going to dress.&nbsp; He did
this half an hour later&mdash;I saw it in his hand when he
repaired to his room.&nbsp; That was the moment at which,
thinking to give her pleasure, I mentioned to Lady Jane that I
was the author of the review.&nbsp; I did give her pleasure, I
judged, but perhaps not quite so much as I had expected.&nbsp; If
the author was &ldquo;only me&rdquo; the thing didn&rsquo;t seem
quite so remarkable.&nbsp; Hadn&rsquo;t I had the effect rather
of diminishing the lustre of the article than of adding to my
own?&nbsp; Her ladyship was subject to the most extraordinary
drops.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t matter; the only effect I cared
about was the one it would have on Vereker up there by his
bedroom fire.</p>
<p>At dinner I watched for the signs of this impression, tried to
fancy some happier light in his eyes; but to my disappointment
Lady Jane gave me no chance to make sure.&nbsp; I had hoped
she&rsquo;d call triumphantly down the table, publicly demand if
she hadn&rsquo;t been right.&nbsp; The party was
large&mdash;there were people from outside as well, but I had
never seen a table long enough to deprive Lady Jane of a
triumph.&nbsp; I was just reflecting in truth that this
interminable board would deprive <i>me</i> of one when the guest
next me, dear woman&mdash;she was Miss Poyle, the vicar&rsquo;s
sister, a robust unmodulated person&mdash;had the happy
inspiration and the unusual courage to address herself across it
to Vereker, who was opposite, but not directly, so that when he
replied they were both leaning forward.&nbsp; She enquired,
artless body, what he thought of Lady Jane&rsquo;s
&ldquo;panegyric,&rdquo; which she had read&mdash;not connecting
it however with her right-hand neighbour; and while I strained my
ear for his reply I heard him, to my stupefaction, call back
gaily, his mouth full of bread: &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all
right&mdash;the usual twaddle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had caught Vereker&rsquo;s glance as he spoke, but Miss
Poyle&rsquo;s surprise was a fortunate cover for my own.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You mean he doesn&rsquo;t do you justice?&rdquo; said the
excellent woman.</p>
<p>Vereker laughed out, and I was happy to be able to do the
same.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a charming article,&rdquo; he
tossed us.</p>
<p>Miss Poyle thrust her chin half across the cloth.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re so deep!&rdquo; she drove home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As deep as the ocean!&nbsp; All I pretend is that the
author doesn&rsquo;t see&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; But a dish was at
this point passed over his shoulder, and we had to wait while he
helped himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t see what?&rdquo; my neighbour
continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t see anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me&mdash;how very stupid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; Vereker laughed main.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nobody does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady on his further side appealed to him, and Miss Poyle
sank back to myself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nobody sees anything!&rdquo;
she cheerfully announced; to which I replied that I had often
thought so too, but had somehow taken the thought for a proof on
my own part of a tremendous eye.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t tell her
the article was mine; and I observed that Lady Jane, occupied at
the end of the table, had not caught Vereker&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>I rather avoided him after dinner, for I confess he struck me
as cruelly conceited, and the revelation was a pain.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The usual twaddle&rdquo;&mdash;my acute little
study!&nbsp; That one&rsquo;s admiration should have had a
reserve or two could gall him to that point!&nbsp; I had thought
him placid, and he was placid enough; such a surface was the hard
polished glass that encased the bauble of his vanity.&nbsp; I was
really ruffled, and the only comfort was that if nobody saw
anything George Corvick was quite as much out of it as I.&nbsp;
This comfort however was not sufficient, after the ladies had
dispersed, to carry me in the proper manner&mdash;I mean in a
spotted jacket and humming an air&mdash;into the
smoking-room.&nbsp; I took my way in some dejection to bed; but
in the passage I encountered Mr. Vereker, who had been up once
more to change, coming out of his room.&nbsp; <i>He</i> was
humming an air and had on a spotted jacket, and as soon as he saw
me his gaiety gave a start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear young man,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad to lay hands on you!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
afraid I most unwittingly wounded you by those words of mine at
dinner to Miss Poyle.&nbsp; I learned but half an hour ago from
Lady Jane that you&rsquo;re the author of the little notice in
<i>The Middle</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I protested that no bones were broken; but he moved with me to
my own door, his hand, on my shoulder, kindly feeling for a
fracture; and on hearing that I had come up to bed he asked leave
to cross my threshold and just tell me in three words what his
qualification of my remarks had represented.&nbsp; It was plain
he really feared I was hurt, and the sense of his solicitude
suddenly made all the difference to me.&nbsp; My cheap review
fluttered off into space, and the best things I had said in it
became flat enough beside the brilliancy of his being
there.&nbsp; I can see him there still, on my rug, in the
firelight and his spotted jacket, his fine clear face all bright
with the desire to be tender to my youth.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know what he had at first meant to say, but I think the sight of
my relief touched him, excited him, brought up words to his lips
from far within.&nbsp; It was so these words presently conveyed
to me something that, as I afterwards knew, he had never uttered
to any one.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve always done justice to the generous
impulse that made him speak; it was simply compunction for a snub
unconsciously administered to a man of letters in a position
inferior to his own, a man of letters moreover in the very act of
praising him.&nbsp; To make the thing right he talked to me
exactly as an equal and on the ground of what we both loved
best.&nbsp; The hour, the place, the unexpectedness deepened the
impression: he couldn&rsquo;t have done anything more intensely
effective.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I <span class="smcap">don&rsquo;t</span> quite know how
to explain it to you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it was the very
fact that your notice of my book had a spice of intelligence, it
was just your exceptional sharpness, that produced the
feeling&mdash;a very old story with me, I beg you to
believe&mdash;under the momentary influence of which I used in
speaking to that good lady the words you so naturally
resent.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t read the things in the newspapers
unless they&rsquo;re thrust upon me as that one
was&mdash;it&rsquo;s always one&rsquo;s best friend who does
it!&nbsp; But I used to read them sometimes&mdash;ten years
ago.&nbsp; I dare say they were in general rather stupider then;
at any rate it always struck me they missed my little point with
a perfection exactly as admirable when they patted me on the back
as when they kicked me in the shins.&nbsp; Whenever since
I&rsquo;ve happened to have a glimpse of them they were still
blazing away&mdash;still missing it, I mean, deliciously.&nbsp;
<i>You</i> miss it, my dear fellow, with inimitable assurance;
the fact of your being awfully clever and your article&rsquo;s
being awfully nice doesn&rsquo;t make a hair&rsquo;s breadth of
difference.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s quite with you rising young
men,&rdquo; Vereker laughed, &ldquo;that I feel most what a
failure I am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I listened with keen interest; it grew keener as he
talked.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>You</i> a failure&mdash;heavens!&nbsp;
What then may your &lsquo;little point&rsquo; happen to
be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I got to <i>tell</i> you, after all these years
and labours?&rdquo;&nbsp; There was something in the friendly
reproach of this&mdash;jocosely exaggerated&mdash;that made me,
as an ardent young seeker for truth, blush to the roots of my
hair.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m as much in the dark as ever, though
I&rsquo;ve grown used in a sense to my obtuseness; at that
moment, however, Vereker&rsquo;s happy accent made me appear to
myself, and probably to him, a rare dunce.&nbsp; I was on the
point of exclaiming &ldquo;Ah yes, don&rsquo;t tell me: for my
honour, for that of the craft, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; when he went
on in a manner that showed he had read my thought and had his own
idea of the probability of our some day redeeming
ourselves.&nbsp; &ldquo;By my little point I mean&mdash;what
shall I call it?&mdash;the particular thing I&rsquo;ve written my
books most <i>for</i>.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t there for every writer a
particular thing of that sort, the thing that most makes him
apply himself, the thing without the effort to achieve which he
wouldn&rsquo;t write at all, the very passion of his passion, the
part of the business in which, for him, the flame of art burns
most intensely?&nbsp; Well, it&rsquo;s <i>that</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I considered a moment&mdash;that is I followed at a respectful
distance, rather gasping.&nbsp; I was fascinated&mdash;easily,
you&rsquo;ll say; but I wasn&rsquo;t going after all to be put
off my guard.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your description&rsquo;s certainly
beautiful, but it doesn&rsquo;t make what you describe very
distinct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise you it would be distinct if it should dawn on
you at all.&rdquo;&nbsp; I saw that the charm of our topic
overflowed for my companion into an emotion as lively as my
own.&nbsp; &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I can
speak for myself: there&rsquo;s an idea in my work without which
I wouldn&rsquo;t have given a straw for the whole job.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s the finest fullest intention of the lot, and the
application of it has been, I think, a triumph of patience, of
ingenuity.&nbsp; I ought to leave that to somebody else to say;
but that nobody does say it is precisely what we&rsquo;re talking
about.&nbsp; It stretches, this little trick of mine, from book
to book, and everything else, comparatively, plays over the
surface of it.&nbsp; The order, the form, the texture of my books
will perhaps some day constitute for the initiated a complete
representation of it.&nbsp; So it&rsquo;s naturally the thing for
the critic to look for.&nbsp; It strikes me,&rdquo; my visitor
added, smiling, &ldquo;even as the thing for the critic to
find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seemed a responsibility indeed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You call it
a little trick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only my little modesty.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
really an exquisite scheme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you hold that you&rsquo;ve carried the scheme
out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way I&rsquo;ve carried it out is the thing in life
I think a bit well of myself for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had a pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you
ought&mdash;just a trifle&mdash;to assist the critic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assist him?&nbsp; What else have I done with every
stroke of my pen?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve shouted my intention in his
great blank face!&rdquo;&nbsp; At this, laughing out again,
Vereker laid his hand on my shoulder to show the allusion
wasn&rsquo;t to my personal appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you talk about the initiated.&nbsp; There must
therefore, you see, <i>be</i> initiation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else in heaven&rsquo;s name is criticism supposed
to be?&rdquo;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid I coloured at this too; but
I took refuge in repeating that his account of his silver lining
was poor in something or other that a plain man knows things
by.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s only because you&rsquo;ve never had
a glimpse of it,&rdquo; he returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you had had
one the element in question would soon have become practically
all you&rsquo;d see.&nbsp; To me it&rsquo;s exactly as palpable
as the marble of this chimney.&nbsp; Besides, the critic just
<i>isn&rsquo;t</i> a plain man: if he were, pray, what would he
be doing in his neighbour&rsquo;s garden?&nbsp; You&rsquo;re
anything but a plain man yourself, and the very raison
d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre of you all is that you&rsquo;re little demons
of subtlety.&nbsp; If my great affair&rsquo;s a secret,
that&rsquo;s only because it&rsquo;s a secret in spite of
itself&mdash;the amazing event has made it one.&nbsp; I not only
never took the smallest precaution to keep it so, but never
dreamed of any such accident.&nbsp; If I had I shouldn&rsquo;t in
advance have had the heart to go on.&nbsp; As it was, I only
became aware little by little, and meanwhile I had done my
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you quite like it?&rdquo; I risked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your secret.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the same
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your guessing that,&rdquo; Vereker replied, &ldquo;is a
proof that you&rsquo;re as clever as I say!&rdquo;&nbsp; I was
encouraged by this to remark that he would clearly be pained to
part with it, and he confessed that it was indeed with him now
the great amusement of life.&nbsp; &ldquo;I live almost to see if
it will ever be detected.&rdquo;&nbsp; He looked at me for a
jesting challenge; something far within his eyes seemed to peep
out.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I needn&rsquo;t worry&mdash;it
won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fire me as I&rsquo;ve never been fired,&rdquo; I
declared; &ldquo;you make me determined to do or
die.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then I asked: &ldquo;Is it a kind of esoteric
message?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His countenance fell at this&mdash;he put out his hand as if
to bid me good-night.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah my dear fellow, it
can&rsquo;t be described in cheap journalese!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew of course he&rsquo;d be awfully fastidious, but our
talk had made me feel how much his nerves were exposed.&nbsp; I
was unsatisfied&mdash;I kept hold of his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t make use of the expression then,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;in the article in which I shall eventually announce my
discovery, though I dare say I shall have hard work to do without
it.&nbsp; But meanwhile, just to hasten that difficult birth,
can&rsquo;t you give a fellow a clue?&rdquo;&nbsp; I felt much
more at my ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My whole lucid effort gives him the clue&mdash;every
page and line and letter.&nbsp; The thing&rsquo;s as concrete
there as a bird in a cage, a bait on a hook, a piece of cheese in
a mouse-trap.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s stuck into every volume as your
foot is stuck into your shoe.&nbsp; It governs every line, it
chooses every word, it dots every i, it places every
comma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I scratched my head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it something in the style
or something in the thought?&nbsp; An element of form or an
element of feeling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He indulgently shook my hand again, and I felt my questions to
be crude and my distinctions pitiful.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good-night, my
dear boy&mdash;don&rsquo;t bother about it.&nbsp; After all, you
do like a fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a little intelligence might spoil it?&rdquo; I
still detained him.</p>
<p>He hesitated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve got a heart in
your body.&nbsp; Is that an element of form or an element of
feeling?&nbsp; What I contend that nobody has ever mentioned in
my work is the organ of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see&mdash;it&rsquo;s some idea <i>about</i> life,
some sort of philosophy.&nbsp; Unless it be,&rdquo; I added with
the eagerness of a thought perhaps still happier, &ldquo;some
kind of game you&rsquo;re up to with your style, something
you&rsquo;re after in the language.&nbsp; Perhaps it&rsquo;s a
preference for the letter P!&rdquo; I ventured profanely to break
out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Papa, potatoes, prunes&mdash;that sort of
thing?&rdquo;&nbsp; He was suitably indulgent: he only said I
hadn&rsquo;t got the right letter.&nbsp; But his amusement was
over; I could see he was bored.&nbsp; There was nevertheless
something else I had absolutely to learn.&nbsp; &ldquo;Should you
be able, pen in hand, to state it clearly yourself&mdash;to name
it, phrase it, formulate it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he almost passionately sighed, &ldquo;if I
were only, pen in hand, one of <i>you</i> chaps!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be a great chance for you of course.&nbsp;
But why should you despise us chaps for not doing what you
can&rsquo;t do yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t do?&rdquo;&nbsp; He opened his eyes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I done it in twenty volumes?&nbsp; I do it
in my way,&rdquo; he continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go <i>you</i> and
don&rsquo;t do it in yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ours is so devilish difficult,&rdquo; I weakly
observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So&rsquo;s mine.&nbsp; We each choose our own.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s no compulsion.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t come down and
smoke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; I want to think this thing out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll tell me then in the morning that
you&rsquo;ve laid me bare?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what I can do; I&rsquo;ll sleep on
it.&nbsp; But just one word more,&rdquo; I added.&nbsp; We had
left the room&mdash;I walked again with him a few steps along the
passage.&nbsp; &ldquo;This extraordinary &lsquo;general
intention,&rsquo; as you call it&mdash;for that&rsquo;s the most
vivid description I can induce you to make of it&mdash;is then,
generally, a sort of buried treasure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His face lighted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, call it that, though
it&rsquo;s perhaps not for me to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; I laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know
you&rsquo;re hugely proud of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t propose to tell you so; but it
<i>is</i> the joy of my soul!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean it&rsquo;s a beauty so rare, so
great?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited a little again.&nbsp; &ldquo;The loveliest thing in
the world!&rdquo;&nbsp; We had stopped, and on these words he
left me; but at the end of the corridor, while I looked after him
rather yearningly, he turned and caught sight of my puzzled
face.&nbsp; It made him earnestly, indeed I thought quite
anxiously, shake his head and wave his finger &ldquo;Give it
up&mdash;give it up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t a challenge&mdash;it was fatherly
advice.&nbsp; If I had had one of his books at hand I&rsquo;d
have repeated my recent act of faith&mdash;I&rsquo;d have spent
half the night with him.&nbsp; At three o&rsquo;clock in the
morning, not sleeping, remembering moreover how indispensable he
was to Lady Jane, I stole down to the library with a
candle.&nbsp; There wasn&rsquo;t, so far as I could discover, a
line of his writing in the house.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Returning</span> to town I feverishly
collected them all; I picked out each in its order and held it up
to the light.&nbsp; This gave me a maddening month, in the course
of which several things took place.&nbsp; One of these, the last,
I may as well immediately mention, was that I acted on
Vereker&rsquo;s advice: I renounced my ridiculous attempt.&nbsp;
I could really make nothing of the business; it proved a dead
loss.&nbsp; After all I had always, as he had himself noted,
liked him; and what now occurred was simply that my new
intelligence and vain preoccupation damaged my liking.&nbsp; I
not only failed to run a general intention to earth, I found
myself missing the subordinate intentions I had formerly
enjoyed.&nbsp; His books didn&rsquo;t even remain the charming
things they had been for me; the exasperation of my search put me
out of conceit of them.&nbsp; Instead of being a pleasure the
more they became a resource the less; for from the moment I was
unable to follow up the author&rsquo;s hint I of course felt it a
point of honour not to make use professionally of my knowledge of
them.&nbsp; I <i>had</i> no knowledge&mdash;nobody had any.&nbsp;
It was humiliating, but I could bear it&mdash;they only annoyed
me now.&nbsp; At last they even bored me, and I accounted for my
confusion&mdash;perversely, I allow&mdash;by the idea that
Vereker had made a fool of me.&nbsp; The buried treasure was a
bad joke, the general intention a monstrous pose.</p>
<p>The great point of it all is, however, that I told George
Corvick what had befallen me and that my information had an
immense effect upon him.&nbsp; He had at last come back, but so,
unfortunately, had Mrs. Erme, and there was as yet, I could see,
no question of his nuptials.&nbsp; He was immensely stirred up by
the anecdote I had brought from Bridges; it fell in so completely
with the sense he had had from the first that there was more in
Vereker than met the eye.&nbsp; When I remarked that the eye
seemed what the printed page had been expressly invented to meet
he immediately accused me of being spiteful because I had been
foiled.&nbsp; Our commerce had always that pleasant
latitude.&nbsp; The thing Vereker had mentioned to me was exactly
the thing he, Corvick, had wanted me to speak of in my
review.&nbsp; On my suggesting at last that with the assistance I
had now given him he would doubtless be prepared to speak of it
himself he admitted freely that before doing this there was more
he must understand.&nbsp; What he would have said, had he
reviewed the new book, was that there was evidently in the
writer&rsquo;s inmost art something to <i>be</i>
understood.&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t so much as hinted at that: no
wonder the writer hadn&rsquo;t been flattered!&nbsp; I asked
Corvick what he really considered he meant by his own
supersubtlety, and, unmistakeably kindled, he replied: &ldquo;It
isn&rsquo;t for the vulgar&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t for the
vulgar!&rdquo;&nbsp; He had hold of the tail of something; he
would pull hard, pull it right out.&nbsp; He pumped me dry on
Vereker&rsquo;s strange confidence and, pronouncing me the
luckiest of mortals, mentioned half a dozen questions he wished
to goodness I had had the gumption to put.&nbsp; Yet on the other
hand he didn&rsquo;t want to be told too much&mdash;it would
spoil the fun of seeing what would come.&nbsp; The failure of
<i>my</i> fun was at the moment of our meeting not complete, but
I saw it ahead, and Corvick saw that I saw it.&nbsp; I, on my
side, saw likewise that one of the first things he would do would
be to rush off with my story to Gwendolen.</p>
<p>On the very day after my talk with him I was surprised by the
receipt of a note from Hugh Vereker, to whom our encounter at
Bridges had been recalled, as he mentioned, by his falling, in a
magazine, on some article to which my signature was
attached.&nbsp; &ldquo;I read it with great pleasure,&rdquo; he
wrote, &ldquo;and remembered under its influence our lively
conversation by your bedroom fire.&nbsp; The consequence of this
has been that I begin to measure the temerity of my having
saddled you with a knowledge that you may find something of a
burden.&nbsp; Now that the fit&rsquo;s over I can&rsquo;t imagine
how I came to be moved so much beyond my wont.&nbsp; I had never
before mentioned, no matter in what state of expansion, the fact
of my little secret, and I shall never speak of that mystery
again.&nbsp; I was accidentally so much more explicit with you
than it had ever entered into my game to be, that I find this
game&mdash;I mean the pleasure of playing it&mdash;suffers
considerably.&nbsp; In short, if you can understand it,
I&rsquo;ve rather spoiled my sport.&nbsp; I really don&rsquo;t
want to give anybody what I believe you clever young men call the
tip.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s of course a selfish solicitude, and I
name it to you for what it may be worth to you.&nbsp; If
you&rsquo;re disposed to humour me don&rsquo;t repeat my
revelation.&nbsp; Think me demented&mdash;it&rsquo;s your right;
but don&rsquo;t tell anybody why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sequel to this communication was that as early on the
morrow as I dared I drove straight to Mr. Vereker&rsquo;s
door.&nbsp; He occupied in those years one of the honest old
houses in Kensington Square.&nbsp; He received me immediately,
and as soon as I came in I saw I hadn&rsquo;t lost my power to
minister to his mirth.&nbsp; He laughed out at sight of my face,
which doubtless expressed my perturbation.&nbsp; I had been
indiscreet&mdash;my compunction was great.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
<i>have</i> told somebody,&rdquo; I panted, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m
sure that person will by this time have told somebody else!&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a woman, into the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The person you&rsquo;ve told?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the other person.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m quite sure he
must have told her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For all the good it will do her&mdash;or do
<i>me</i>!&nbsp; A woman will never find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but she&rsquo;ll talk all over the place:
she&rsquo;ll do just what you don&rsquo;t want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vereker thought a moment, but wasn&rsquo;t so disconcerted as
I had feared: he felt that if the harm was done it only served
him right.&nbsp; &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter&mdash;don&rsquo;t
worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best, I promise you, that your talk
with me shall go no further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good; do what you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the meantime,&rdquo; I pursued, &ldquo;George
Corvick&rsquo;s possession of the tip may, on his part, really
lead to something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be a brave day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told him about Corvick&rsquo;s cleverness, his admiration,
the intensity of his interest in my anecdote; and without making
too much of the divergence of our respective estimates mentioned
that my friend was already of opinion that he saw much further
into a certain affair than most people.&nbsp; He was quite as
fired as I had been at Bridges.&nbsp; He was moreover in love
with the young lady: perhaps the two together would puzzle
something out.</p>
<p>Vereker seemed struck with this.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you mean
they&rsquo;re to be married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say that&rsquo;s what it will come
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may help them,&rdquo; he conceded, &ldquo;but we
must give them time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I spoke of my own renewed assault and confessed my
difficulties; whereupon he repeated his former advice:
&ldquo;Give it up, give it up!&rdquo;&nbsp; He evidently
didn&rsquo;t think me intellectually equipped for the
adventure.&nbsp; I stayed half an hour, and he was most
good-natured, but I couldn&rsquo;t help pronouncing him a man of
unstable moods.&nbsp; He had been free with me in a mood, he had
repented in a mood, and now in a mood he had turned
indifferent.&nbsp; This general levity helped me to believe that,
so far as the subject of the tip went, there wasn&rsquo;t much in
it.&nbsp; I contrived however to make him answer a few more
questions about it, though he did so with visible
impatience.&nbsp; For himself, beyond doubt, the thing we were
all so blank about was vividly there.&nbsp; It was something, I
guessed, in the primal plan, something like a complex figure in a
Persian carpet.&nbsp; He highly approved of this image when I
used it, and he used another himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
very string,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that my pearls are strung
on!&rdquo;&nbsp; The reason of his note to me had been that he
really didn&rsquo;t want to give us a grain of succour&mdash;our
density was a thing too perfect in its way to touch.&nbsp; He had
formed the habit of depending on it, and if the spell was to
break it must break by some force of its own.&nbsp; He comes back
to me from that last occasion&mdash;for I was never to speak to
him again&mdash;as a man with some safe preserve for sport.&nbsp;
I wondered as I walked away where he had got <i>his</i> tip.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I spoke to George Corvick of
the caution I had received he made me feel that any doubt of his
delicacy would be almost an insult.&nbsp; He had instantly told
Gwendolen, but Gwendolen&rsquo;s ardent response was in itself a
pledge of discretion.&nbsp; The question would now absorb them
and would offer them a pastime too precious to be shared with the
crowd.&nbsp; They appeared to have caught instinctively at
Vereker&rsquo;s high idea of enjoyment.&nbsp; Their intellectual
pride, however, was not such as to make them indifferent to any
further light I might throw on the affair they had in hand.&nbsp;
They were indeed of the &ldquo;artistic temperament,&rdquo; and I
was freshly struck with my colleague&rsquo;s power to excite
himself over a question of art.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d call it letters,
he&rsquo;d call it life, but it was all one thing.&nbsp; In what
he said I now seemed to understand that he spoke equally for
Gwendolen, to whom, as soon as Mrs. Erme was sufficiently better
to allow her a little leisure, he made a point of introducing
me.&nbsp; I remember our going together one Sunday in August to a
huddled house in Chelsea, and my renewed envy of Corvick&rsquo;s
possession of a friend who had some light to mingle with his
own.&nbsp; He could say things to her that I could never say to
him.&nbsp; She had indeed no sense of humour and, with her pretty
way of holding her head on one side, was one of those persons
whom you want, as the phrase is, to shake, but who have learnt
Hungarian by themselves.&nbsp; She conversed perhaps in Hungarian
with Corvick; she had remarkably little English for his
friend.&nbsp; Corvick afterwards told me that I had chilled her
by my apparent indisposition to oblige them with the detail of
what Vereker had said to me.&nbsp; I allowed that I felt I had
given thought enough to that indication: hadn&rsquo;t I even made
up my mind that it was vain and would lead nowhere?&nbsp; The
importance they attached to it was irritating and quite envenomed
my doubts.</p>
<p>That statement looks unamiable, and what probably happened was
that I felt humiliated at seeing other persons deeply beguiled by
an experiment that had brought me only chagrin.&nbsp; I was out
in the cold while, by the evening fire, under the lamp, they
followed the chase for which I myself had sounded the horn.&nbsp;
They did as I had done, only more deliberately and
sociably&mdash;they went over their author from the
beginning.&nbsp; There was no hurry, Corvick said the future was
before them and the fascination could only grow; they would take
him page by page, as they would take one of the classics, inhale
him in slow draughts and let him sink all the way in.&nbsp; They
would scarce have got so wound up, I think, if they hadn&rsquo;t
been in love: poor Vereker&rsquo;s inner meaning gave them
endless occasion to put and to keep their young heads
together.&nbsp; None the less it represented the kind of problem
for which Corvick had a special aptitude, drew out the particular
pointed patience of which, had he lived, he would have given more
striking and, it is to be hoped, more fruitful examples.&nbsp; He
at least was, in Vereker&rsquo;s words, a little demon of
subtlety.&nbsp; We had begun by disputing, but I soon saw that
without my stirring a finger his infatuation would have its bad
hours.&nbsp; He would bound off on false scents as I had
done&mdash;he would clap his hands over new lights and see them
blown out by the wind of the turned page.&nbsp; He was like
nothing, I told him, but the maniacs who embrace some
bedlamitical theory of the cryptic character of
Shakespeare.&nbsp; To this he replied that if we had had
Shakespeare&rsquo;s own word for his being cryptic he would at
once have accepted it.&nbsp; The case there was altogether
different&mdash;we had nothing but the word of Mr. Snooks.&nbsp;
I returned that I was stupefied to see him attach such importance
even to the word of Mr. Vereker.&nbsp; He wanted thereupon to
know if I treated Mr. Vereker&rsquo;s word as a lie.&nbsp; I
wasn&rsquo;t perhaps prepared, in my unhappy rebound, to go so
far as that, but I insisted that till the contrary was proved I
should view it as too fond an imagination.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t,
I confess, say&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t at that time quite
know&mdash;all I felt.&nbsp; Deep down, as Miss Erme would have
said, I was uneasy, I was expectant.&nbsp; At the core of my
disconcerted state&mdash;for my wonted curiosity lived in its
ashes&mdash;was the sharpness of a sense that Corvick would at
last probably come out somewhere.&nbsp; He made, in defence of
his credulity, a great point of the fact that from of old, in his
study of this genius, he had caught whiffs and hints of he
didn&rsquo;t know what, faint wandering notes of a hidden
music.&nbsp; That was just the rarity, that was the charm: it
fitted so perfectly into what I reported.</p>
<p>If I returned on several occasions to the little house in
Chelsea I dare say it was as much for news of Vereker as for news
of Miss Erme&rsquo;s ailing parent.&nbsp; The hours spent there
by Corvick were present to my fancy as those of a chessplayer
bent with a silent scowl, all the lamplit winter, over his board
and his moves.&nbsp; As my imagination filled it out the picture
held me fast.&nbsp; On the other side of the table was a
ghostlier form, the faint figure of an antagonist good-humouredly
but a little wearily secure&mdash;an antagonist who leaned back
in his chair with his hands in his pockets and a smile on his
fine clear face.&nbsp; Close to Corvick, behind him, was a girl
who had begun to strike me as pale and wasted and even, on more
familiar view, as rather handsome, and who rested on his shoulder
and hung on his moves.&nbsp; He would take up a chessman and hold
it poised a while over one of the little squares, and then would
put it back in its place with a long sigh of
disappointment.&nbsp; The young lady, at this, would slightly but
uneasily shift her position and look across, very hard, very
long, very strangely, at their dim participant.&nbsp; I had asked
them at an early stage of the business if it mightn&rsquo;t
contribute to their success to have some closer communication
with him.&nbsp; The special circumstances would surely be held to
have given me a right to introduce them.&nbsp; Corvick
immediately replied that he had no wish to approach the altar
before he had prepared the sacrifice.&nbsp; He quite agreed with
our friend both as to the delight and as to the honour of the
chase&mdash;he would bring down the animal with his own
rifle.&nbsp; When I asked him if Miss Erme were as keen a shot he
said after thinking: &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m ashamed to say she
wants to set a trap.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d give anything to see him;
she says she requires another tip.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s really quite
morbid about it.&nbsp; But she must play fair&mdash;she
<i>shan&rsquo;t</i> see him!&rdquo; he emphatically added.&nbsp;
I wondered if they hadn&rsquo;t even quarrelled a little on the
subject&mdash;a suspicion not corrected by the way he more than
once exclaimed to me: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s quite incredibly
literary, you know&mdash;quite fantastically!&rdquo;&nbsp; I
remember his saying of her that she felt in italics and thought
in capitals.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh when I&rsquo;ve run him to
earth,&rdquo; he also said, &ldquo;then, you know, I shall knock
at his door.&nbsp; Rather&mdash;I beg you to believe.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll have it from his own lips: &lsquo;Right you are, my
boy; you&rsquo;ve done it this time!&rsquo;&nbsp; He shall crown
me victor&mdash;with the critical laurel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile he really avoided the chances London life might have
given him of meeting the distinguished novelist; a danger,
however, that disappeared with Vereker&rsquo;s leaving England
for an indefinite absence, as the newspapers
announced&mdash;going to the south for motives connected with the
health of his wife, which had long kept her in retirement.&nbsp;
A year&mdash;more than a year&mdash;had elapsed since the
incident at Bridges, but I had had no further sight of him.&nbsp;
I think I was at bottom rather ashamed&mdash;I hated to remind
him that, though I had irremediably missed his point, a
reputation for acuteness was rapidly overtaking me.&nbsp; This
scruple led me a dance; kept me out of Lady Jane&rsquo;s house,
made me even decline, when in spite of my bad manners she was a
second time so good as to make me a sign, an invitation to her
beautiful seat.&nbsp; I once became aware of her under
Vereker&rsquo;s escort at a concert, and was sure I was seen by
them, but I slipped out without being caught.&nbsp; I felt, as on
that occasion I splashed along in the rain, that I couldn&rsquo;t
have done anything else; and yet I remember saying to myself that
it was hard, was even cruel.&nbsp; Not only had I lost the books,
but I had lost the man himself: they and their author had been
alike spoiled for me.&nbsp; I knew too which was the loss I most
regretted.&nbsp; I had taken to the man still more than I had
ever taken to the books.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Six</span> months after our friend had
left England George Corvick, who made his living by his pen,
contracted for a piece of work which imposed on him an absence of
some length and a journey of some difficulty, and his undertaking
of which was much of a surprise to me.&nbsp; His brother-in-law
had become editor of a great provincial paper, and the great
provincial paper, in a fine flight of fancy, had conceived the
idea of sending a &ldquo;special commissioner&rdquo; to
India.&nbsp; Special commissioners had begun, in the
&ldquo;metropolitan press,&rdquo; to be the fashion, and the
journal in question must have felt it had passed too long for a
mere country cousin.&nbsp; Corvick had no hand, I knew, for the
big brush of the correspondent, but that was his
brother-in-law&rsquo;s affair, and the fact that a particular
task was not in his line was apt to be with himself exactly a
reason for accepting it.&nbsp; He was prepared to out-Herod the
metropolitan press; he took solemn precautions against
priggishness, he exquisitely outraged taste.&nbsp; Nobody ever
knew it&mdash;that offended principle was all his own.&nbsp; In
addition to his expenses he was to be conveniently paid, and I
found myself able to help him, for the usual fat book, to a
plausible arrangement with the usual fat publisher.&nbsp; I
naturally inferred that his obvious desire to make a little money
was not unconnected with the prospect of a union with Gwendolen
Erme.&nbsp; I was aware that her mother&rsquo;s opposition was
largely addressed to his want of means and of lucrative
abilities, but it so happened that, on my saying the last time I
saw him something that bore on the question of his separation
from our young lady, he brought out with an emphasis that
startled me: &ldquo;Ah I&rsquo;m not a bit engaged to her, you
know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not overtly,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;because her
mother doesn&rsquo;t like you.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ve always taken
for granted a private understanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there <i>was</i> one.&nbsp; But there isn&rsquo;t
now.&rdquo;&nbsp; That was all he said save something about Mrs.
Erme&rsquo;s having got on her feet again in the most
extraordinary way&mdash;a remark pointing, as I supposed, the
moral that private understandings were of little use when the
doctor didn&rsquo;t share them.&nbsp; What I took the liberty of
more closely inferring was that the girl might in some way have
estranged him.&nbsp; Well, if he had taken the turn of jealousy
for instance it could scarcely be jealousy of me.&nbsp; In that
case&mdash;over and above the absurdity of it&mdash;he
wouldn&rsquo;t have gone away just to leave us together.&nbsp;
For some time before his going we had indulged in no allusion to
the buried treasure, and from his silence, which my reserve
simply emulated, I had drawn a sharp conclusion.&nbsp; His
courage had dropped, his ardour had gone the way of
mine&mdash;this appearance at least he left me to scan.&nbsp;
More than that he couldn&rsquo;t do; he couldn&rsquo;t face the
triumph with which I might have greeted an explicit
admission.&nbsp; He needn&rsquo;t have been afraid, poor dear,
for I had by this time lost all need to triumph.&nbsp; In fact I
considered I showed magnanimity in not reproaching him with his
collapse, for the sense of his having thrown up the game made me
feel more than ever how much I at last depended on him.&nbsp; If
Corvick had broken down I should never know; no one would be of
any use if <i>he</i> wasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t a bit
true I had ceased to care for knowledge; little by little my
curiosity not only had begun to ache again, but had become the
familiar torment of my days and my nights.&nbsp; There are
doubtless people to whom torments of such an order appear hardly
more natural than the contortions of disease; but I don&rsquo;t
after all know why I should in this connexion so much as mention
them.&nbsp; For the few persons, at any rate, abnormal or not,
with whom my anecdote is concerned, literature was a game of
skill, and skill meant courage, and courage meant honour, and
honour meant passion, meant life.&nbsp; The stake on the table
was of a special substance and our roulette the revolving mind,
but we sat round the green board as intently as the grim gamblers
at Monte Carlo.&nbsp; Gwendolen Erme, for that matter, with her
white face and her fixed eyes, was of the very type of the lean
ladies one had met in the temples of chance.&nbsp; I recognised
in Corvick&rsquo;s absence that she made this analogy
vivid.&nbsp; It was extravagant, I admit, the way she lived for
the art of the pen.&nbsp; Her passion visibly preyed on her, and
in her presence I felt almost tepid.&nbsp; I got hold of
&ldquo;Deep Down&rdquo; again: it was a desert in which she had
lost herself, but in which too she had dug a wonderful hole in
the sand&mdash;a cavity out of which Corvick had still more
remarkably pulled her.</p>
<p>Early in March I had a telegram from her, in consequence of
which I repaired immediately to Chelsea, where the first thing
she said to me was: &ldquo;He has got it, he has got
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was moved, as I could see, to such depths that she must
mean the great thing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Vereker&rsquo;s
idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His general intention.&nbsp; George has cabled from
Bombay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had the missive open there; it was emphatic though
concise.&nbsp; &ldquo;Eureka.&nbsp; Immense.&rdquo;&nbsp; That
was all&mdash;he had saved the cost of the signature.&nbsp; I
shared her emotion, but I was disappointed.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
doesn&rsquo;t say what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could he&mdash;in a telegram?&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll
write it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how does he know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know it&rsquo;s the real thing?&nbsp; Oh I&rsquo;m sure
that when you see it you do know.&nbsp; Vera incessu patuit
dea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you, Miss Erme, who are a &lsquo;dear&rsquo;
for bringing me such news!&rdquo;&mdash;I went all lengths in my
high spirits.&nbsp; &ldquo;But fancy finding our goddess in the
temple of Vishnu!&nbsp; How strange of George to have been able
to go into the thing again in the midst of such different and
such powerful solicitations!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t gone into it, I know; it&rsquo;s the
thing itself, let severely alone for six months, that has simply
sprung out at him like a tigress out of the jungle.&nbsp; He
didn&rsquo;t take a book with him&mdash;on purpose; indeed he
wouldn&rsquo;t have needed to&mdash;he knows every page, as I do,
by heart.&nbsp; They all worked in him together, and some day
somewhere, when he wasn&rsquo;t thinking, they fell, in all their
superb intricacy, into the one right combination.&nbsp; The
figure in the carpet came out.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the way he knew
it would come and the real reason&mdash;you didn&rsquo;t in the
least understand, but I suppose I may tell you now&mdash;why he
went and why I consented to his going.&nbsp; We knew the change
would do it&mdash;that the difference of thought, of scene, would
give the needed touch, the magic shake.&nbsp; We had perfectly,
we had admirably calculated.&nbsp; The elements were all in his
mind, and in the secousse of a new and intense experience they
just struck light.&rdquo;&nbsp; She positively struck light
herself&mdash;she was literally, facially luminous.&nbsp; I
stammered something about unconscious cerebration, and she
continued: &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll come right home&mdash;this will
bring him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To see Vereker, you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To see Vereker&mdash;and to see <i>me</i>.&nbsp; Think
what he&rsquo;ll have to tell me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hesitated.&nbsp; &ldquo;About India?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About fiddlesticks!&nbsp; About Vereker&mdash;about the
figure in the carpet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, as you say, we shall surely have that in a
letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thought like one inspired, and I remembered how Corvick
had told me long before that her face was interesting.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Perhaps it can&rsquo;t be got into a letter if it&rsquo;s
&lsquo;immense.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not if it&rsquo;s immense bosh.&nbsp; If he has
hold of something that can&rsquo;t be got into a letter he
hasn&rsquo;t hold of <i>the</i> thing.&nbsp; Vereker&rsquo;s own
statement to me was exactly that the &lsquo;figure&rsquo;
<i>would</i> fit into a letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I cabled to George an hour ago&mdash;two
words,&rdquo; said Gwendolen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it indiscreet of me to ask what they
were?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hung fire, but at last brought them out.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Angel, write.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make
it sure&mdash;I&rsquo;ll send him the same.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My</span> words however were not
absolutely the same&mdash;I put something instead of
&ldquo;angel&rdquo;; and in the sequel my epithet seemed the more
apt, for when eventually we heard from our traveller it was
merely, it was thoroughly to be tantalised.&nbsp; He was
magnificent in his triumph, he described his discovery as
stupendous; but his ecstasy only obscured it&mdash;there were to
be no particulars till he should have submitted his conception to
the supreme authority.&nbsp; He had thrown up his commission, he
had thrown up his book, he had thrown up everything but the
instant need to hurry to Rapallo, on the Genoese shore, where
Vereker was making a stay.&nbsp; I wrote him a letter which was
to await him at Aden&mdash;I besought him to relieve my
suspense.&nbsp; That he had found my letter was indicated by a
telegram which, reaching me after weary days and in the absence
of any answer to my laconic dispatch to him at Bombay, was
evidently intended as a reply to both communications.&nbsp; Those
few words were in familiar French, the French of the day, which
Covick often made use of to show he wasn&rsquo;t a prig.&nbsp; It
had for some persons the opposite effect, but his message may
fairly be paraphrased.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have patience; I want to see,
as it breaks on you, the face you&rsquo;ll make!&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tellement envie de voir ta t&ecirc;te!&rdquo;&mdash;that
was what I had to sit down with.&nbsp; I can certainly not be
said to have sat down, for I seem to remember myself at this time
as rattling constantly between the little house in Chelsea and my
own.&nbsp; Our impatience, Gwendolen&rsquo;s and mine, was equal,
but I kept hoping her light would be greater.&nbsp; We all spent
during this episode, for people of our means, a great deal of
money in telegrams and cabs, and I counted on the receipt of news
from Rapallo immediately after the junction of the discoverer
with the discovered.&nbsp; The interval seemed an age, but late
one day I heard a hansom precipitated to my door with the crash
engendered by a hint of liberality.&nbsp; I lived with my heart
in my mouth and accordingly bounded to the window&mdash;a
movement which gave me a view of a young lady erect on the
footboard of the vehicle and eagerly looking up at my
house.&nbsp; At sight of me she flourished a paper with a
movement that brought me straight down, the movement with which,
in melodramas, handkerchiefs and reprieves are flourished at the
foot of the scaffold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just seen Vereker&mdash;not a note wrong.&nbsp; Pressed
me to bosom&mdash;keeps me a month.&rdquo;&nbsp; So much I read
on her paper while the cabby dropped a grin from his perch.&nbsp;
In my excitement I paid him profusely and in hers she suffered
it; then as he drove away we started to walk about and
talk.&nbsp; We had talked, heaven knows, enough before, but this
was a wondrous lift.&nbsp; We pictured the whole scene at
Rapallo, where he would have written, mentioning my name, for
permission to call; that is <i>I</i> pictured it, having more
material than my companion, whom I felt hang on my lips as we
stopped on purpose before shop-windows we didn&rsquo;t look
into.&nbsp; About one thing we were clear: if he was staying on
for fuller communication we should at least have a letter from
him that would help us through the dregs of delay.&nbsp; We
understood his staying on, and yet each of us saw, I think, that
the other hated it.&nbsp; The letter we were clear about arrived;
it was for Gwendolen, and I called on her in time to save her the
trouble of bringing it to me.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t read it out,
as was natural enough; but she repeated to me what it chiefly
embodied.&nbsp; This consisted of the remarkable statement that
he&rsquo;d tell her after they were married exactly what she
wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only <i>then</i>, when I&rsquo;m his wife&mdash;not
before,&rdquo; she explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s tantamount
to saying&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;that I must marry him
straight off!&rdquo;&nbsp; She smiled at me while I flushed with
disappointment, a vision of fresh delay that made me at first
unconscious of my surprise.&nbsp; It seemed more than a hint that
on me as well he would impose some tiresome condition.&nbsp;
Suddenly, while she reported several more things from his letter,
I remembered what he had told me before going away.&nbsp; He had
found Mr. Vereker deliriously interesting and his own possession
of the secret a real intoxication.&nbsp; The buried treasure was
all gold and gems.&nbsp; Now that it was there it seemed to grow
and grow before him; it would have been, through all time and
taking all tongues, one of the most wonderful flowers of literary
art.&nbsp; Nothing, in especial, once you were face to face with
it, could show for more consummately <i>done</i>.&nbsp; When once
it came out it came out, was there with a splendour that made you
ashamed; and there hadn&rsquo;t been, save in the bottomless
vulgarity of the age, with every one tasteless and tainted, every
sense stopped, the smallest reason why it should have been
overlooked.&nbsp; It was great, yet so simple, was simple, yet so
great, and the final knowledge of it was an experience quite
apart.&nbsp; He intimated that the charm of such an experience,
the desire to drain it, in its freshness, to the last drop, was
what kept him there close to the source.&nbsp; Gwendolen, frankly
radiant as she tossed me these fragments, showed the elation of a
prospect more assured than my own.&nbsp; That brought me back to
the question of her marriage, prompted me to ask if what she
meant by what she had just surprised me with was that she was
under an engagement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am!&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know it?&rdquo;&nbsp; She seemed
astonished, but I was still more so, for Corvick had told me the
exact contrary.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t mention this, however; I
only reminded her how little I had been on that score in her
confidence, or even in Corvick&rsquo;s, and that, moreover I
wasn&rsquo;t in ignorance of her mother&rsquo;s interdict.&nbsp;
At bottom I was troubled by the disparity of the two accounts;
but after a little I felt Corvick&rsquo;s to be the one I least
doubted.&nbsp; This simply reduced me to asking myself if the
girl had on the spot improvised an engagement&mdash;vamped up an
old one or dashed off a new&mdash;in order to arrive at the
satisfaction she desired.&nbsp; She must have had resources of
which I was destitute, but she made her case slightly more
intelligible by returning presently: &ldquo;What the state of
things has been is that we felt of course bound to do nothing in
mamma&rsquo;s lifetime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now you think you&rsquo;ll just dispense with
mamma&rsquo;s consent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah it mayn&rsquo;t come to that!&rdquo;&nbsp; I
wondered what it might come to, and she went on: &ldquo;Poor
dear, she may swallow the dose.&nbsp; In fact, you know,&rdquo;
she added with a laugh, &ldquo;she really
<i>must</i>!&rdquo;&mdash;a proposition of which, on behalf of
every one concerned, I fully acknowledged the force.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Nothing</span> more vexatious had ever
happened to me than to become aware before Corvick&rsquo;s
arrival in England that I shouldn&rsquo;t be there to put him
through.&nbsp; I found myself abruptly called to Germany by the
alarming illness of my younger brother, who, against my advice,
had gone to Munich to study, at the feet indeed of a great
master, the art of portraiture in oils.&nbsp; The near relative
who made him an allowance had threatened to withdraw it if he
should, under specious pretexts, turn for superior truth to
Paris&mdash;Paris being somehow, for a Cheltenham aunt, the
school of evil, the abyss.&nbsp; I deplored this prejudice at the
time, and the deep injury of it was now visible&mdash;first in
the fact that it hadn&rsquo;t saved the poor boy, who was clever,
frail and foolish, from congestion of the lungs, and second in
the greater break with London to which the event condemned
me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid that what was uppermost in my mind
during several anxious weeks was the sense that if we had only
been in Paris I might have run over to see Corvick.&nbsp; This
was actually out of the question from every point of view: my
brother, whose recovery gave us both plenty to do, was ill for
three months, during which I never left him and at the end of
which we had to face the absolute prohibition of a return to
England.&nbsp; The consideration of climate imposed itself, and
he was in no state to meet it alone.&nbsp; I took him to Meran
and there spent the summer with him, trying to show him by
example how to get back to work and nursing a rage of another
sort that I tried <i>not</i> to show him.</p>
<p>The whole business proved the first of a series of phenomena
so strangely interlaced that, taken together&mdash;which was how
I had to take them&mdash;they form as good an illustration as I
can recall of the manner in which, for the good of his soul
doubtless, fate sometimes deals with a man&rsquo;s avidity.&nbsp;
These incidents certainly had larger bearings than the
comparatively meagre consequence we are here concerned
with&mdash;though I feel that consequence also a thing to speak
of with some respect.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s mainly in such a light, I
confess, at any rate, that the ugly fruit of my exile is at this
hour present to me.&nbsp; Even at first indeed the spirit in
which my avidity, as I have called it, made me regard that term
owed no element of ease to the fact that before coming back from
Rapallo George Corvick addressed me in a way I objected to.&nbsp;
His letter had none of the sedative action I must to-day profess
myself sure he had wished to give it, and the march of
occurrences was not so ordered as to make up for what it
lacked.&nbsp; He had begun on the spot, for one of the
quarterlies, a great last word on Vereker&rsquo;s writings, and
this exhaustive study, the only one that would have counted, have
existed, was to turn on the new light, to utter&mdash;oh, so
quietly!&mdash;the unimagined truth.&nbsp; It was in other words
to trace the figure in the carpet through every convolution, to
reproduce it in every tint.&nbsp; The result, according to my
friend, would be the greatest literary portrait ever painted, and
what he asked of me was just to be so good as not to trouble him
with questions till he should hang up his masterpiece before
me.&nbsp; He did me the honour to declare that, putting aside the
great sitter himself, all aloft in his indifference, I was
individually the connoisseur he was most working for.&nbsp; I was
therefore to be a good boy and not try to peep under the curtain
before the show was ready: I should enjoy it all the more if I
sat very still.</p>
<p>I did my best to sit very still, but I couldn&rsquo;t help
giving a jump on seeing in <i>The Times</i>, after I had been a
week or two in Munich and before, as I knew, Corvick had reached
London, the announcement of the sudden death of poor Mrs.
Erme.&nbsp; I instantly, by letter, appealed to Gwendolen for
particulars, and she wrote me that her mother had yielded to
long-threatened failure of the heart.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t say,
but I took the liberty of reading into her words, that from the
point of view of her marriage and also of her eagerness, which
was quite a match for mine, this was a solution more prompt than
could have been expected and more radical than waiting for the
old lady to swallow the dose.&nbsp; I candidly admit indeed that
at the time&mdash;for I heard from her repeatedly&mdash;I read
some singular things into Gwendolen&rsquo;s words and some still
more extraordinary ones into her silences.&nbsp; Pen in hand,
this way, I live the time over, and it brings back the oddest
sense of my having been, both for months and in spite of myself,
a kind of coerced spectator.&nbsp; All my life had taken refuge
in my eyes, which the procession of events appeared to have
committed itself to keep astare.&nbsp; There were days when I
thought of writing to Hugh Vereker and simply throwing myself on
his charity.&nbsp; But I felt more deeply that I hadn&rsquo;t
fallen quite so low&mdash;besides which, quite properly, he would
send me about my business.&nbsp; Mrs. Erme&rsquo;s death brought
Corvick straight home, and within the month he was united
&ldquo;very quietly&rdquo;&mdash;as quietly, I seemed to make
out, as he meant in his article to bring out his
trouvaille&mdash;to the young lady he had loved and
quitted.&nbsp; I use this last term, I may parenthetically say,
because I subsequently grew sure that at the time he went to
India, at the time of his great news from Bombay, there had been
no positive pledge between them whatever.&nbsp; There had been
none at the moment she was affirming to me the very
opposite.&nbsp; On the other hand he had certainly become engaged
the day he returned.&nbsp; The happy pair went down to Torquay
for their honeymoon, and there, in a reckless hour, it occurred
to poor Corvick to take his young bride a drive.&nbsp; He had no
command of that business: this had been brought home to me of old
in a little tour we had once made together in a dogcart.&nbsp; In
a dogcart he perched his companion for a rattle over Devonshire
hills, on one of the likeliest of which he brought his horse,
who, it was true, had bolted, down with such violence that the
occupants of the cart were hurled forward and that he fell
horribly on his head.&nbsp; He was killed on the spot; Gwendolen
escaped unhurt.</p>
<p>I pass rapidly over the question of this unmitigated tragedy,
of what the loss of my best friend meant for me, and I complete
my little history of my patience and my pain by the frank
statement of my having, in a postscript to my very first letter
to her after the receipt of the hideous news, asked Mrs. Corvick
whether her husband mightn&rsquo;t at least have finished the
great article on Vereker.&nbsp; Her answer was as prompt as my
question: the article, which had been barely begun, was a mere
heartbreaking scrap.&nbsp; She explained that our friend, abroad,
had just settled down to it when interrupted by her
mother&rsquo;s death, and that then, on his return, he had been
kept from work by the engrossments into which that calamity was
to plunge them.&nbsp; The opening pages were all that existed;
they were striking, they were promising, but they didn&rsquo;t
unveil the idol.&nbsp; That great intellectual feat was obviously
to have formed his climax.&nbsp; She said nothing more, nothing
to enlighten me as to the state of her own knowledge&mdash;the
knowledge for the acquisition of which I had fancied her
prodigiously acting.&nbsp; This was above all what I wanted to
know: had <i>she</i> seen the idol unveiled?&nbsp; Had there been
a private ceremony for a palpitating audience of one?&nbsp; For
what else but that ceremony had the nuptials taken place?&nbsp; I
didn&rsquo;t like as yet to press her, though when I thought of
what had passed between us on the subject in Corvick&rsquo;s
absence her reticence surprised me.&nbsp; It was therefore not
till much later, from Meran, that I risked another appeal, risked
it in some trepidation, for she continued to tell me
nothing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you hear in those few days of your
blighted bliss,&rdquo; I wrote, &ldquo;what we desired so to
hear?&rdquo;&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;we,&rdquo; as a little hint and
she showed me she could take a little hint; &ldquo;I heard
everything,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and I mean to keep it to
myself!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was impossible not to be moved
with the strongest sympathy for her, and on my return to England
I showed her every kindness in my power.&nbsp; Her mother&rsquo;s
death had made her means sufficient, and she had gone to live in
a more convenient quarter.&nbsp; But her loss had been great and
her visitation cruel; it never would have occurred to me moreover
to suppose she could come to feel the possession of a technical
tip, of a piece of literary experience, a counterpoise to her
grief.&nbsp; Strange to say, none the less, I couldn&rsquo;t help
believing after I had seen her a few times that I caught a
glimpse of some such oddity.&nbsp; I hasten to add that there had
been other things I couldn&rsquo;t help believing, or at least
imagining; and as I never felt I was really clear about these,
so, as to the point I here touch on, I give her memory the
benefit of the doubt.&nbsp; Stricken and solitary, highly
accomplished and now, in her deep mourning, her maturer grace and
her uncomplaining sorrow, incontestably handsome, she presented
herself as leading a life of singular dignity and beauty.&nbsp; I
had at first found a way to persuade myself that I should soon
get the better of the reserve formulated, the week after the
catastrophe in her reply to an appeal as to which I was not
unconscious that it might strike her as mistimed.&nbsp; Certainly
that reserve was something of a shock to me&mdash;certainly it
puzzled me the more I thought of it and even though I tried to
explain it (with moments of success) by an imputation of exalted
sentiments, of superstitious scruples, of a refinement of
loyalty.&nbsp; Certainly it added at the same time hugely to the
price of Vereker&rsquo;s secret, precious as this mystery already
appeared.&nbsp; I may as well confess abjectly that Mrs.
Corvick&rsquo;s unexpected attitude was the final tap on the nail
that was to fix fast my luckless idea, convert it into the
obsession of which I&rsquo;m for ever conscious.</p>
<p>But this only helped me the more to be artful, to be adroit,
to allow time to elapse before renewing my suit.&nbsp; There were
plenty of speculations for the interval, and one of them was
deeply absorbing.&nbsp; Corvick had kept his information from his
young friend till after the removal of the last barrier to their
intimacy&mdash;then only had he let the cat out of the bag.&nbsp;
Was it Gwendolen&rsquo;s idea, taking a hint from him, to
liberate this animal only on the basis of the renewal of such a
relation?&nbsp; Was the figure in the carpet traceable or
describable only for husbands and wives&mdash;for lovers
supremely united?&nbsp; It came back to me in a mystifying manner
that in Kensington Square, when I mentioned that Corvick would
have told the girl he loved, some word had dropped from Vereker
that gave colour to this possibility.&nbsp; There might be little
in it, but there was enough to make me wonder if I should have to
marry Mrs. Corvick to get what I wanted.&nbsp; Was I prepared to
offer her this price for the blessing of her knowledge?&nbsp; Ah
that way madness lay!&mdash;so I at least said to myself in
bewildered hours.&nbsp; I could see meanwhile the torch she
refused to pass on flame away in her chamber of memory&mdash;pour
through her eyes a light that shone in her lonely house.&nbsp; At
the end of six months I was fully sure of what this warm presence
made up to her for.&nbsp; We had talked again and again of the
man who had brought us together&mdash;of his talent, his
character, his personal charm, his certain career, his dreadful
doom, and even of his clear purpose in that great study which was
to have been a supreme literary portrait, a kind of critical
Vandyke or Velasquez.&nbsp; She had conveyed to me in abundance
that she was tongue-tied by her perversity, by her piety, that
she would never break the silence it had not been given to the
&ldquo;right person,&rdquo; as she said, to break.&nbsp; The hour
however finally arrived.&nbsp; One evening when I had been
sitting with her longer than usual I laid my hand firmly on her
arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now at last what <i>is</i> it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had been expecting me and was ready.&nbsp; She gave a long
slow soundless headshake, merciful only in being
inarticulate.&nbsp; This mercy didn&rsquo;t prevent its hurling
at me the largest finest coldest &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; I had yet,
in the course of a life that had known denials, had to take full
in the face.&nbsp; I took it and was aware that with the hard
blow the tears had come into my eyes.&nbsp; So for a while we sat
and looked at each other; after which I slowly rose, I was
wondering if some day she would accept me; but this was not what
I brought out.&nbsp; I said as I smoothed down my hat: &ldquo;I
know what to think then.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A remote disdainful pity for me gathered in her dim smile;
then she spoke in a voice that I hear at this hour:
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my <i>life</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; As I stood at the
door she added: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve insulted him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean Vereker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean the Dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I recognised when I reached the street the justice of her
charge.&nbsp; Yes, it was her life&mdash;I recognised that too;
but her life none the less made room with the lapse of time for
another interest.&nbsp; A year and a half after Corvick&rsquo;s
death she published in a single volume her second novel,
&ldquo;Overmastered,&rdquo; which I pounced on in the hope of
finding in it some tell-tale echo or some peeping face.&nbsp; All
I found was a much better book than her younger performance,
showing I thought the better company she had kept.&nbsp; As a
tissue tolerably intricate it was a carpet with a figure of its
own; but the figure was not the figure I was looking for.&nbsp;
On sending a review of it to <i>The Middle</i> I was surprised to
learn from the office that a notice was already in type.&nbsp;
When the paper came out I had no hesitation in attributing this
article, which I thought rather vulgarly overdone, to Drayton
Deane, who in the old days had been something of a friend of
Corvick&rsquo;s, yet had only within a few weeks made the
acquaintance of his widow.&nbsp; I had had an early copy of the
book, but Deane had evidently had an earlier.&nbsp; He lacked all
the same the light hand with which Corvick had gilded the
gingerbread&mdash;he laid on the tinsel in splotches.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Six</span> months later appeared
&ldquo;The Right of Way,&rdquo; the last chance, though we
didn&rsquo;t know it, that we were to have to redeem
ourselves.&nbsp; Written wholly during Vereker&rsquo;s sojourn
abroad, the book had been heralded, in a hundred paragraphs, by
the usual ineptitudes.&nbsp; I carried it, as early a copy as
any, I this time flattered myself, straightway to Mrs.
Corvick.&nbsp; This was the only use I had for it; I left the
inevitable tribute of <i>The Middle</i> to some more ingenious
mind and some less irritated temper.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I already
have it,&rdquo; Gwendolen said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Drayton Deane was so
good as to bring it to me yesterday, and I&rsquo;ve just finished
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday?&nbsp; How did he get it so soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He gets everything so soon!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s to review
it in <i>The Middle</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;Drayton Deane&mdash;review
Vereker?&rdquo;&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t believe my ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Why not?&nbsp; One fine ignorance is as good as
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I winced but I presently said: &ldquo;You ought to review him
yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t &lsquo;review,&rsquo;&rdquo; she
laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m reviewed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the door was thrown open.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah yes,
here&rsquo;s your reviewer!&rdquo;&nbsp; Drayton Deane was there
with his long legs and his tall forehead: he had come to see what
she thought of &ldquo;The Right of Way,&rdquo; and to bring news
that was singularly relevant.&nbsp; The evening papers were just
out with a telegram on the author of that work, who, in Rome, had
been ill for some days with an attack of malarial fever.&nbsp; It
had at first not been thought grave, but had taken, in
consequence of complications, a turn that might give rise to
anxiety.&nbsp; Anxiety had indeed at the latest hour begun to be
felt.</p>
<p>I was struck in the presence of these tidings with the
fundamental detachment that Mrs. Corvick&rsquo;s overt concern
quite failed to hide: it gave me the measure of her consummate
independence.&nbsp; That independence rested on her knowledge,
the knowledge which nothing now could destroy and which nothing
could make different.&nbsp; The figure in the carpet might take
on another twist or two, but the sentence had virtually been
written.&nbsp; The writer might go down to his grave: she was the
person in the world to whom&mdash;as if she had been his favoured
heir&mdash;his continued existence was least of a need.&nbsp;
This reminded me how I had observed at a particular
moment&mdash;after Corvick&rsquo;s death&mdash;the drop of her
desire to see him face to face.&nbsp; She had got what she wanted
without that.&nbsp; I had been sure that if she hadn&rsquo;t got
it she wouldn&rsquo;t have been restrained from the endeavour to
sound him personally by those superior reflexions, more
conceivable on a man&rsquo;s part than on a woman&rsquo;s, which
in my case had served an a deterrent.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t
however, I hasten to add, that my case, in spite of this
invidious comparison, wasn&rsquo;t ambiguous enough.&nbsp; At the
thought that Vereker was perhaps at that moment dying there
rolled over me a wave of anguish&mdash;a poignant sense of how
inconsistently I still depended on him.&nbsp; A delicacy that it
was my one compensation to suffer to rule me had left the Alps
and the Apennines between us, but the sense of the waning
occasion suggested that I might in my despair at last have gone
to him.&nbsp; Of course I should really have done nothing of the
sort.&nbsp; I remained five minutes, while my companions talked
of the new book, and when Drayton Deane appealed to me for my
opinion of it I made answer, getting up, that I detested Hugh
Vereker and simply couldn&rsquo;t read him.&nbsp; I departed with
the moral certainty that as the door closed behind me Deane would
brand me for awfully superficial.&nbsp; His hostess
wouldn&rsquo;t contradict <i>that</i> at least.</p>
<p>I continue to trace with a briefer touch our intensely odd
successions.&nbsp; Three weeks after this came Vereker&rsquo;s
death, and before the year was out the death of his wife.&nbsp;
That poor lady I had never seen, but I had had a futile theory
that, should she survive him long enough to be decorously
accessible, I might approach her with the feeble flicker of my
plea.&nbsp; Did she know and if she knew would she speak?&nbsp;
It was much to be presumed that for more reasons than one she
would have nothing to say; but when she passed out of all reach I
felt renannouncement indeed my appointed lot.&nbsp; I was shut up
in my obsession for ever&mdash;my gaolers had gone off with the
key.&nbsp; I find myself quite as vague as a captive in a dungeon
about the tinge that further elapsed before Mrs. Corvick became
the wife of Drayton Deane.&nbsp; I had foreseen, through my bars,
this end of the business, though there was no indecent haste and
our friendship had fallen rather off.&nbsp; They were both so
&ldquo;awfully intellectual&rdquo; that it struck people as a
suitable match, but I had measured better than any one the wealth
of understanding the bride would contribute to the union.&nbsp;
Never, for a marriage in literary circles&mdash;so the newspapers
described the alliance&mdash;had a lady been so bravely
dowered.&nbsp; I began with due promptness to look for the fruit
of the affair&mdash;that fruit, I mean, of which the premonitory
symptoms would be peculiarly visible in the husband.&nbsp; Taking
for granted the splendour of the other party&rsquo;s nuptial
gift, I expected to see him make a show commensurate with his
increase of means.&nbsp; I knew what his means had been&mdash;his
article on &ldquo;The Right of Way&rdquo; had distinctly given
one the figure.&nbsp; As he was now exactly in the position in
which still more exactly I was not I watched from month to month,
in the likely periodicals, for the heavy message poor Corvick had
been unable to deliver and the responsibility of which would have
fallen on his successor.&nbsp; The widow and wife would have
broken by the rekindled hearth the silence that only a widow and
wife might break, and Deane would be as aflame with the knowledge
as Corvick in his own hour, as Gwendolen in hers, had been.&nbsp;
Well, he was aflame doubtless, but the fire was apparently not to
become a public blaze.&nbsp; I scanned the periodicals in vain:
Drayton Deane filled them with exuberant pages, but he withheld
the page I most feverishly sought.&nbsp; He wrote on a thousand
subjects, but never on the subject of Vereker.&nbsp; His special
line was to tell truths that other people either
&ldquo;funked,&rdquo; as he said, or overlooked, but he never
told the only truth that seemed to me in these days to
signify.&nbsp; I met the couple in those literary circles
referred to in the papers: I have sufficiently intimated that it
was only in such circles we were all constructed to
revolve.&nbsp; Gwendolen was more than ever committed to them by
the publication of her third novel, and I myself definitely
classed by holding the opinion that this work was inferior to its
immediate predecessor.&nbsp; Was it worse because she had been
keeping worse company?&nbsp; If her secret was, as she had told
me, her life&mdash;a fact discernible in her increasing bloom, an
air of conscious privilege that, cleverly corrected by pretty
charities, gave distinction to her appearance&mdash;it had yet
not a direct influence on her work.&nbsp; That only made
one&mdash;everything only made one&mdash;yearn the more for it;
only rounded it off with a mystery finer and subtler.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was therefore from her husband I
could never remove my eyes: I beset him in a manner that might
have made him uneasy.&nbsp; I went even so far as to engage him
in conversation.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t he know, hadn&rsquo;t he come
into it as a matter of course?&mdash;that question hummed in my
brain.&nbsp; Of course he knew; otherwise he wouldn&rsquo;t
return my stare so queerly.&nbsp; His wife had told him what I
wanted and he was amiably amused at my impotence.&nbsp; He
didn&rsquo;t laugh&mdash;he wasn&rsquo;t a laugher: his system
was to present to my irritation, so that I should crudely expose
myself, a conversational blank as vast as his big bare
brow.&nbsp; It always happened that I turned away with a settled
conviction from these unpeopled expanses, which seemed to
complete each other geographically and to symbolise together
Drayton Deane&rsquo;s want of voice, want of form.&nbsp; He
simply hadn&rsquo;t the art to use what he knew; he literally was
incompetent to take up the duty where Corvick had left it.&nbsp;
I went still further&mdash;it was the only glimpse of happiness I
had.&nbsp; I made up my mind that the duty didn&rsquo;t appeal to
him.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t interested, he didn&rsquo;t
care.&nbsp; Yes, it quite comforted me to believe him too stupid
to have joy of the thing I lacked.&nbsp; He was as stupid after
as he had been before, and that deepened for me the golden glory
in which the mystery was wrapped.&nbsp; I had of course none the
less to recollect that his wife might have imposed her conditions
and exactions.&nbsp; I had above all to remind myself that with
Vereker&rsquo;s death the major incentive dropped.&nbsp; He was
still there to be honoured by what might be done&mdash;he was no
longer there to give it his sanction.&nbsp; Who alas but he had
the authority?</p>
<p>Two children were born to the pair, but the second cost the
mother her life.&nbsp; After this stroke I seemed to see another
ghost of a chance.&nbsp; I jumped at it in thought, but I waited
a certain time for manners, and at last my opportunity arrived in
a remunerative way.&nbsp; His wife had been dead a year when I
met Drayton Deane in the smoking-room of a small club of which we
both were members, but where for months&mdash;perhaps because I
rarely entered it&mdash;I hadn&rsquo;t seen him.&nbsp; The room
was empty and the occasion propitious.&nbsp; I deliberately
offered him, to have done with the matter for ever, that
advantage for which I felt he had long been looking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As an older acquaintance of your late wife&rsquo;s than
even you were,&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;you must let me say to you
something I have on my mind.&nbsp; I shall be glad to make any
terms with you that you see fit to name for the information she
must have had from George Corvick&mdash;the information you know,
that had come to him, poor chap, in one of the happiest hours of
his life, straight from Hugh Vereker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at me like a dim phrenological bust.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The information&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vereker&rsquo;s secret, my dear man&mdash;the general
intention of his books: the string the pearls were strung on, the
buried treasure, the figure in the carpet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began to flush&mdash;the numbers on his bumps to come
out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Vereker&rsquo;s books had a general
intention?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stared in my turn.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say
you don&rsquo;t know it?&rdquo;&nbsp; I thought for a moment he
was playing with me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mrs. Deane knew it; she had it,
as I say, straight from Corvick, who had, after infinite search
and to Vereker&rsquo;s own delight, found the very mouth of the
cave.&nbsp; Where <i>is</i> the mouth?&nbsp; He told after their
marriage&mdash;and told alone&mdash;the person who, when the
circumstances were reproduced, must have told you.&nbsp; Have I
been wrong in taking for granted that she admitted you, as one of
the highest privileges of the relation in which you stood to her,
to the knowledge of which she was after Corvick&rsquo;s death the
sole depositary?&nbsp; All I know is that that knowledge is
infinitely precious, and what I want you to understand is that if
you&rsquo;ll in your turn admit me to it you&rsquo;ll do me a
kindness for which I shall be lastingly grateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had turned at last very red; I dare say he had begun by
thinking I had lost my wits.&nbsp; Little by little he followed
me; on my own side I stared with a livelier surprise.&nbsp; Then
he spoke. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t acting&mdash;it was the absurd truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> tell you&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing about Hugh Vereker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was stupefied; the room went round.&nbsp; It had been too
good even for that!&nbsp; &ldquo;Upon your honour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my honour.&nbsp; What the devil&rsquo;s the matter
with you?&rdquo; he growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m astounded&mdash;I&rsquo;m disappointed.&nbsp;
I wanted to get it out of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t in me!&rdquo; he awkwardly
laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;And even if it were&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it were you&rsquo;d let me have it&mdash;oh yes, in
common humanity.&nbsp; But I believe you.&nbsp; I see&mdash;I
see!&rdquo; I went on, conscious, with the full turn of the
wheel, of my great delusion, my false view of the poor
man&rsquo;s attitude.&nbsp; What I saw, though I couldn&rsquo;t
say it, was that his wife hadn&rsquo;t thought him worth
enlightening.&nbsp; This struck me as strange for a woman who had
thought him worth marrying.&nbsp; At last I explained it by the
reflexion that she couldn&rsquo;t possibly have married him for
his understanding.&nbsp; She had married him for something
else.</p>
<p>He was to some extent enlightened now, but he was even more
astonished, more disconcerted: he took a moment to compare my
story with his quickened memories.&nbsp; The result of his
meditation was his presently saying with a good deal of rather
feeble form: &ldquo;This is the first I hear of what you allude
to.&nbsp; I think you must be mistaken as to Mrs. Drayton
Deane&rsquo;s having had any unmentioned, and still less any
unmentionable, knowledge of Hugh Vereker.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d
certainly have wished it&mdash;should it have borne on his
literary character&mdash;to be used.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was used.&nbsp; She used it herself.&nbsp; She told
me with her own lips that she &lsquo;lived&rsquo; on
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had no sooner spoken than I repented of my words; he grew so
pale that I felt as if I had struck him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,
&lsquo;lived&rsquo;&mdash;!&rdquo; he murmured, turning short
away from me.</p>
<p>My compunction was real; I laid my hand on his shoulder.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I beg you to forgive me&mdash;I&rsquo;ve made a
mistake.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know what I thought you
knew.&nbsp; You could, if I had been right, have rendered me a
service; and I had my reasons for assuming that you&rsquo;d be in
a position to meet me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your reasons?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;What were
your reasons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at him well; I hesitated; I considered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come and sit down with me here, and I&rsquo;ll tell
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; I drew him to a sofa, I lighted another cigar
and, beginning with the anecdote of Vereker&rsquo;s one descent
from the clouds, I recited to him the extraordinary chain of
accidents that had, in spite of the original gleam, kept me till
that hour in the dark.&nbsp; I told him in a word just what
I&rsquo;ve written out here.&nbsp; He listened with deepening
attention, and I became aware, to my surprise, by his
ejaculations, by his questions, that he would have been after all
not unworthy to be trusted by his wife.&nbsp; So abrupt an
experience of her want of trust had now a disturbing effect on
him; but I saw the immediate shock throb away little by little
and then gather again into waves of wonder and
curiosity&mdash;waves that promised, I could perfectly judge, to
break in the end with the fury of my own highest tides.&nbsp; I
may say that to-day as victims of unappeased desire there
isn&rsquo;t a pin to choose between us.&nbsp; The poor
man&rsquo;s state is almost my consolation; there are really
moments when I feel it to be quite my revenge.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
